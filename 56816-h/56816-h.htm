  <h2 class='c007'>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>The</span> favourable reception given by the press
and the public to the first edition of “Hints
on Driving,” which has run out in a little over
three months, gives me hopes that a reprint
of it will also be acceptable.</p>

<p class='c004'>For this edition the sheets have been carefully
revised throughout, and some additions
have been made, many of which have been
suggested to me during a short period of
service in India. Several new illustrations
have also been added.</p>

<p class='c004'>General Albert Williams, who has kindly
interested himself in this work, has given me
permission to insert the following letter:</p>

<p class='c009'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Morley Knight</span>,</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have heard with pleasure that a second
edition of your book on Driving is about to
be published, and feel sure that it will be as
well appreciated as the first has been. The
book is full of valuable information most useful
to beginners, and many professed coachmen
might read it with advantage. The latter,
like doctors, differ on many points, but I feel
sure all good coachmen will be glad to know
that your endeavours to instruct in the art of
Driving have been so well received, and will
welcome the new edition, the success of which
I shall look forward to with confidence.</p>

<p class='c010'>  “Yours very truly,</p>

<p class='c010'>    “<span class='sc'>Albert H. Williams</span>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I have also to thank His Grace the Duke
of Beaufort, K.G., for his kindly advice, and
the numerous hints and corrections which I
have endeavoured to incorporate in this
volume.</p>

    <div>HINTS ON DRIVING.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='intro' class='c016'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>In</span> the following pages an attempt has been
made to explain to beginners the rudimentary
principles and niceties of driving.</p>

<p class='c004'>In most treatises on this subject the minute
details have been entirely omitted, the writer
taking for granted that the reader has previously
acquired some practical knowledge of
harnessing and driving.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is of course impossible to describe in a
short essay every method of handling the
ribbons, for well-known authorities even of
the present day differ on so many points, that
to discuss all would take too long. Nevertheless,
as nothing has been considered too
trifling to be explained, it is hoped that
these hints may be especially useful to those
who may not have been able to obtain
any previous experience, and have not a
thoroughly competent tutor at hand to teach
them.</p>

<p class='c004'>The difficulties which have to be overcome
are so numerous that they cannot all be
discussed in detail, for one of the greatest
charms of driving consists in the ever-varying
and complicated problems which are being
constantly placed before the driver to solve—problems
which must be solved at once without
hesitation—and in no sport or pastime
does the old saw, “He who hesitates is lost,”
more frequently prove true than in that of
driving. Thus, though it happens that the
same result may be obtained in a variety of
ways by the practised hand, these notes being
especially intended for the instruction of
beginners, the author has endeavoured to
solve, in the most simple and lucid manner,
those problems only which are most likely to
puzzle the novice.</p>

<p class='c004'>After all, there is no way of learning to
drive so instructive as sitting on the box seat
beside a first-class coachman, and carefully
watching the movements of his hands. The
novice is always tempted to confine his attention
to the horses, and so omits to notice the
manipulation of the reins at the critical
moment. This omission on his part should
be carefully avoided, as the crisis is over in
so short a space of time that it is most important
to keep the attention fixed almost
entirely on the driver’s hands, and carefully
to commit to memory every detail of the
handling of the ribbons. In this work no
new theories on the art of driving have been
advanced, but many very old ones have been
specially emphasized by repetition—a course
which has been considered justifiable on
account of their great importance.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch01' class='c007'>CHAPTER I <br /> <br /> HARNESS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>It</span> is often said by those who have little or no
experience, that four horses steady themselves,
and require therefore little skill in
driving. This is a very great error, and a man
who is keen to learn should make it his first
aim to drive one horse well, and having
thoroughly mastered this accomplishment, he
should then proceed to handle a pair. In
driving the great aim is to get the horses
going well together, and all doing their fair
share of work without taking more out of the
driver than is absolutely necessary. In order
to arrive at this it is essential to have the
horses properly bitted, rightly coupled, comfortably
poled up, and the harness fitted
correctly.</p>

<p class='c004'>To begin at the beginning, it is first of all
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Fitting of harness. The collar.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
necessary to see that the harness fits the
horse. The collar is a very important point.
This should lie flat on the horse’s shoulders,
so as to give sufficient room for the fingers to
pass between it and the horse’s neck at the
sides, and the flat of the hand should be able
to pass freely between the lower part of the
collar and the horse’s neck. Before putting
the collar on, it ought to be widened by
lateral pressure with the knee, so as not to
hurt the horse’s eyes while passing over his
head. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Sore shoulders.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> If the horse’s shoulders should get
rubbed, the best remedy is to apply plenty of
sweet oil. This prevents the skin getting
hard and the hair coming off. Salt water
should never be used.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Hames.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The hames should fit the groove in the
collar, which should be well recessed, correctly
all round and be buckled up tightly, otherwise
in double harness they are very liable to
be pulled out when going down hill, or when
pulling up suddenly. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Hames straps.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
To prevent this, a small
strap may be buckled round the bottom of
the collar over the hame links.</p>

<p class='c004'>With a pair, the hames straps should be
buckled on so that the ends point inwards.</p>

<p class='c004'>The traces should be of such a length that
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The traces.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the backband will lie on about the middle
of the pad when the horse is in draught;
the horse will then not be drawing the
cart by the backband. Care should be
taken that the tugs are in front of the stops
on the shaft, or a bad accident may occur
owing to the cart running on to the horse’s
quarters.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c004'>The width of the reins may vary from
seven-eighths of an inch to an inch and
a quarter, according to the length of the
driver’s fingers, but about one inch will be
found the most suitable width for general
purposes. The reins should not be too thick,
or they will always be hard and stiff, while,
on the other hand, if they are very thin,
they will be uncomfortably soft in wet
weather.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Backband.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In a two-wheeled cart the backband ought to be long
enough to allow the shafts to hang level. There ought always to be a
little weight on the shafts, as nothing looks so vulgar as shafts
pointing up to the skies, with all the weight on the belly-band.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Shafts and balance of cart.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It must be borne in mind that by
letting down the shafts the balance of the cart can be very
considerably altered. This alteration is often useful when there are
four people in the cart, as few dog-carts balance well
with this number, the weight being nearly
always on the belly-band. Few owners
thoroughly appreciate what misery their
friends undergo when made to occupy a back
seat under these conditions, as they so rarely
try it themselves.</p>

<p class='c004'>The belly-band should not hang down
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Belly-band.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> quite loose, but, while allowing a little play of
the shafts, should be tight enough to prevent
them from tipping up to any extent.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Girth of pad.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The pad as well as the crupper should be
buckled up pretty tight if there are any steep
hills to go down, and a breeching is not used;
otherwise the pad will slip forward and gall
the horse’s withers. Sore withers give a great
deal of trouble and are difficult to cure.
Another result of the pad slipping forward is
chafing of the horse’s elbows. On some
horses the only way to prevent it is to fasten
the girth back to the shaft on each side by
means of straps. This plan is frequently
used in hansoms in London. The pad itself
should be well stuffed off the back, particularly
with high-withered horses.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The blinkers.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The blinkers should be so fitted that the horse’s eyes come almost in
the middle of them, while the headstall should be tight enough to
prevent the blinkers from bulging out when pressure is put on the bit,
and thus enabling the horse to see behind him; but they should be
fitted so as not to turn inwards and almost touch the eyes.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Horse’s comfort reflected in manner of going.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> This is a point
which is very often little attended to, but one which makes a
considerable difference to the horse’s comfort, and is naturally
reflected in his manner of going.</p>

<p class='c004'>The throat-lash should not be fastened too
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Throat-lash.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> tight; if it is,
it will half choke the horse. It
should be loose enough to allow three fingers
to be passed between it and the horse’s throat.</p>

<p class='c004'>The nose-band should admit of the breadth
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Nose-band.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> of two fingers between it and the horse’s jaw.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Bitting.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Bitting is all a matter of common sense and
practice. The reins must be altered up or
down the bit until the adjustment most comfortable
for the horse has been discovered.
But even then a great deal will depend on
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Hands.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> what is generally known as “Hands.” This
really unknown quantity, consisting as it does
of complete sympathy between the horse and
his driver, though born and not made, can be
improved to some extent by teaching and
practice. This gift has been defined as “not
using more force on the reins than the exigencies
of the occasion render absolutely
necessary.” As a general rule the bit should
lie flat in the horse’s mouth about one inch
above the tusks.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Curb-chain.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The curb-chain must not be too tight,
and there ought to be room for at least
two fingers to be placed between it and
the horse’s jaw. If a horse is at all inclined
to be a puller, an ignorant groom
will very often fix it as tight as he can,
with the probable result that the horse will
jib or pull all the harder. In the latter case
he will be likely to get a sore under the
jaw. The best remedy for this is to fix
a piece of leather on the chain, so that the
latter does not rub on the sore place. If
a horse bores to the near side, putting the
rein down lower on the off than on the near
side will very often make him go straight, and
<i>vice versâ</i>. Some horses pull with very sharp
bits, and will not do so with a snaffle, while
others do just the contrary. A double-ring
snaffle covered with leather or made of indiarubber
is useful for very light-mouthed horses.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Use of a net.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
A net usually stops horses pulling for a
time, but it is doubtful whether it has a
permanent effect; so that it is better to
leave it off occasionally.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Bearing-rein.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
If a horse is inclined to put his head down,
and bore, a bearing-rein will prevent him
from doing so; but it must not be too tight.
There are many horses that would be undrivable
without one, as it keeps their heads
in the proper position, and thus takes the
weight off the driver’s hand. When driving
a young horse or a bad kicker it is always
advisable to have a loose one on, as it will
prevent him from becoming unmanageable by
putting his head between his legs. The
American pattern, which passes from the
bearing-rein hook on the pad over the top of
the horse’s head, through a keeper on the
headpiece between his ears, down to the
bridoon is very useful for a hard puller.</p>

<p class='c004'>The correct adjustment of a bearing-rein
requires a certain amount of practice, as when
the horse is standing still it always appears
much tighter than it really is.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Bitting of a pulling horse.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Sometimes a very hard puller, especially in
a team, can be driven with a big Liverpool
bit hanging loose in his mouth and with
the reins fixed to a bridoon; a bearing-rein
can also be fitted on this bridoon if required.</p>

<p class='c004'>A martingale will prove effective in the
case of horses who pull owing to their habit
of star-gazing.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sometimes a horse pulls by getting hold of
the cheek of the bit with his lip. This can be
met with the elbow-bit, which is an improvement
on the Liverpool bit, as, by having a bend
in it, the cheek is so far back that the horse cannot
reach it with his lips or tongue. The reason
that this bit is not more generally used is that
many people consider it unsightly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Indiarubber-covered bits, especially those
with a double bar, also answer very well with
some pulling horses, the effect then being
to make the bit work on a different part
of the mouth from that to which they are
accustomed.</p>

<p class='c004'>A double bar can easily be improvised by
sewing a piece of leather, like a lip-strap,
only larger, across the top of an ordinary bit,
just below the end of the headpiece.</p>

<p class='c004'>An inveterate puller may in time get used
to any bit, in which case frequent change is
the only remedy.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Every horse’s mouth has a key.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In fact there is a key to almost every
horse’s mouth if it can only be found, and it
is well worth taking considerable trouble to
find it; though frequently much patience and
many experiments will be required before
a successful result is obtained, and the man
who has to drive many horses must have a
large assortment of bits.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Martingale.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> A martingale is excellent for a horse that
carries his head in the air, and also very
effective for one that rears. It should be
so adjusted as to keep the nose about in
line with the withers, and is generally fixed
to the nose-band, but may be attached to the
bit, and when so attached it is better to use a
half-moon snaffle, or one without a joint in it,
as this greatly reduces the chances of the
corners of the horse’s mouth getting sore.</p>

<p class='c004'>Circular pieces of leather, called cheek
leathers, are also very useful in this respect
with ordinary bits, as they keep the corners
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Corners of mouth sore.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of the horse’s mouth from being pinched by
the cheeks, and also prevent to a certain
extent his getting hold of them with his
lips.</p>

<p class='c004'>For a horse that has only one side to
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>One-sided mouth.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> his mouth, it often answers to have a few
tacks put on the inside of the piece of
leather, which effectually stops him from
leaning his head out to that side.</p>

<p class='c004'>These pieces have a round hole in the
middle, which fits the bar of the bit, and
a slit from this hole to the outside, so that
they can be put on and taken off quite easily.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Kicking-strap.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Kicking-straps can be used either in single
or double harness. In the former the strap
passes up from one of the shafts through
a loop in the crupper, and down to the
other shaft. In double harness two straps
are required. These are fixed to the pad,
from which they run parallel to the crupper
down to the splinter bar. They are connected
by a short strap across the loins. Kicking-straps
should be so adjusted that there should
be plenty of room for the movement of the
horse’s quarters, as if he breaks into a canter
they are liable to catch his quarters and so
make him kick. A good rule is to allow
a hand’s breadth between the horse’s back
and this strap.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Fitting of breeching.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> A breeching is a necessity in a hilly country,
more especially with a two-wheeled cart,
when a brake is of no use. It should hang
about a foot below the upper part of the
dock, and have about four to six inches’
play when the horse is in the collar.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Three kinds of breeching.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> There are three kinds of breechings for a
dog-cart.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first starts from the tug on one end
of the backband, and goes right round the
horse’s quarters to the tug on the other.</p>

<p class='c004'>The second buckles to loops on each shaft,
these loops being placed half way between
the stops and the front of the cart.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Brown’s patent.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The third consists of a broad strap, which
is stretched fairly taut across the shafts about
six or eight inches from the front of the
cart. This one is always ready and requires
no adjustment, looks neat, and answers admirably.
It is known as Brown’s patent.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first method is better than the second,
because it does not require any extra loops on
the shafts, which tend to weaken them considerably,
and also it does not take any of the
paint off.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Breeching rubbing the horse.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> If a horse’s quarters should get rubbed
by the breeching, the best plan to prevent any
further damage is to have a large piece
of sheepskin sewn round the strap, with the
hair next the horse.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Crupper.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The crupper ought to be fitted so that
there is room for the breadth of the hand, or
about four inches, between it and the horse’s
back, when the pad is in the right place.
Great care should be taken that all the
hairs of the tail are passed through the
crupper.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Breast harness.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Breast harness can very often be substituted
for collars with great advantage,
especially when the horses’ necks get wrung
by the latter.</p>

<p class='c004'>This method of draught also obviates the
necessity of keeping a large number of collars
to fit all sorts of horses, while another advantage
is, that you are able to use breechings to
the best advantage in double harness.</p>

<p class='c004'>The breast strap should be made of a
strong leather strap, about three inches wide,
and padded inside so that the hard edges do
not touch the skin.</p>

<p class='c004'>For double harness a ring must be sewn
into the middle for the purpose of attaching
the pole chains.</p>

<p class='c004'>The breast strap is held up by a light strap
passing over the horse’s withers, and the
breeching, by a similar strap, passing over the
croup. A crupper can be used, but is not
necessary.</p>

<p class='c004'>The breast straps should lie flat, and be
kept well above the point of the shoulders.
They must be carefully adjusted, the usual
fault being that they are placed too low.
Each end of the breast strap has a buckle,
into which both the trace and the end of the
breeching are fastened. Of course it is impossible
to get as much work out of a horse
with breast harness as with collars.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Whip.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The whip should be as light as possible,
and well balanced, the thong being about half
the length of the stick. The points should
always be of leather, as these are much the
best in wet weather. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Always hang whip up.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> A whip should never
be allowed to stand in a corner or up against
a wall, as it will very quickly warp in that position.
It should always be kept hung up, either
on a reel or by a string to a nail in the wall.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before leaving the subject of harness, a
word on the general appearance and neatness
of turn-out will not be out of place. Straps
ought to be shortened to fit the horse, and be
no longer than absolutely necessary.</p>

<p class='c004'>To prevent any ends flapping about, keepers
must be tight, and fitted so as to be within an
inch or two of the points of the straps.
Nothing catches the eye more quickly, or
looks more slovenly, than the ends of the
traces sticking out a foot beyond the keepers,
or a belly-band strap dangling loose underneath
the horse.</p>

<p class='c004'>When buying harness go to a really good
maker: cheap clumsy harness never pays.</p>

</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The start.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Before starting, always have a good look
round, and see that all the harness is put on
correctly; then go to the off side of the horse
and take the reins in the right hand, the near
rein under the forefinger and the off rein
under the third finger. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Getting into dog-cart.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Get up into the
cart and sit down immediately; now transfer
the reins into the left hand, the near rein
over the forefinger, and the off rein under
the middle finger. Thus you have two fingers
between the reins (fig. 2). The reason
for this is that it gives much more scope
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How to hold reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
for play of the wrist on the horse’s mouth
than if you only have one finger between
the reins. The thumb should point straight
to the right, and the forefinger be held well
out, pointing to the right rear. This will
keep the near rein close up to the knuckle,
and the horse may easily be moved across
the road to either the left or right by
turning the back of the hand up or down
respectively.</p>

<p>FIG. 2.—SINGLE HARNESS—POSITION OF THE HANDS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Sit well up.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Sit well up; nothing looks so bad as to see
the driver leaning forward over the reins.</p>

<p class='c004'>Finally, take the whip in the right hand at
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How to start.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the place where it balances most comfortably,
and you are ready to start. Then give the
horse the office to start by feeling his mouth
gently and speaking to him; if he does not
respond touch him gently with the whip.</p>

<p class='c004'>The moment he starts drop the hand
slightly; jibbing is often caused by neglect
of the latter precaution.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Elbows must be close to sides.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Keep your elbows close to your sides,
with the points almost touching the hips.
The wrists should be well bent, as by this
means you are enabled to keep a perfectly
steady bearing on the horse’s mouth without
any jerking. This is a very important
point.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Fore arm horizontal.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The fore arm should be horizontal, and the
fingers from two to four inches from the
centre of the body, with the knuckles to the
front.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Lower fingers to grip the reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The thumb must not be pressed down on
the rein, except when a loop is taken up to
turn a corner to the right or left (see fig. 23),
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How to turn.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> when the right hand is available for shortening
the other rein to prevent the horse turning
too rapidly, or else to use the whip to bring
him round.</p>

<p class='c004'>The fingers which should grip the reins, (so
tightly that they should never slip), are the
three lower ones. The forefinger should be
held as in fig. 2.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Whip not to be used when hand on reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Never keep a large amount of slack of the
off rein in your right hand (fig. 3), as then
you cannot use the whip; and remember
never to hit the horse while the right hand is
holding a rein.</p>

<p class='c004'>The reason for this is obvious, because if
you do try to hit him when you have the
off rein in the right hand, you must slack
that rein off, and the horse immediately
dashes away to the left.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 3.—SINGLE HARNESS—RIGHT HAND IN WRONG POSITION.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Never move reins in left hand.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It cannot be too strongly impressed on the
beginner, that whether the right hand is on
the reins or not, they should always be of
the same length in the hand, and never be
allowed to slip.</p>

<p class='c004'>The right hand should never on any
account take the off rein out of the left hand.
It is the first and most important law of
driving, that the reins, as held in the left hand,
should be of such a length as to keep the
horse straight, and should remain at that
length, whether the right hand is being used
on one or other of them or not.</p>

<p class='c004'>No coachman who drives with a rein in
each hand can be said to know his business,
and yet it is one of the commonest things to
be seen in London.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Do not job horse’s mouth.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Never use the whip on the horse unnecessarily,
and never job him in the mouth except
to punish him for doing something wrong.
Nevertheless, for a horse which is inclined to
kick, jobbing is very useful when applied at
the right time, more especially if accompanied
by a sharp hit with the whip over his
ears.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Never hit a shier.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The whip should never be used on a shier,
it will only frighten him, and confirm him in
the habit, which is caused by nervousness
and not by vice. Encourage him rather by
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Use the voice.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> speaking to him, as there is nothing a horse
learns to understand quicker than his master’s
voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>Do not flap the reins on his back either
to start him or to make him increase his
pace.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Pace should be steady.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Learn to drive at a steady and even pace.
From eight to nine miles an hour will usually
be found most suitable to average horses, but
do not on any account drive sometimes at six
miles and sometimes at ten. Nothing tires a
horse so much as constantly changing the pace.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Start slow.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It is usually better to start a little slower,
especially if you have a long way to go.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once fairly started, keep your eyes well
fixed in front of you, and watch exactly what
other vehicles are doing, so that you may
never have to pull up suddenly. You should
be able to see from a distance whether you
can get through or not, and if you see that
you cannot, begin to slow down at once.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Jerky pace very bad.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Never increase your pace, or check it, suddenly.
Nothing is more uncomfortable for
the passengers or more wearying to the
horse.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is far better for the beginner to slow
down at once, if he is not sure of getting
through a tight place, than to go fast up to it,
and then have to pull up quite suddenly, if he
can pull up at all. This cannot always be
done at the last moment, and an accident is
the result. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Shortening reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
As a rule, when it is necessary to
pull up in a hurry, the reins cannot be shortened
except by throwing up the hands, which,
to say the least of it, looks very unbusinesslike.
The proper course to pursue is to catch hold
of the reins with the first finger and thumb of
the right hand just behind the left, and shorten
them as much as necessary by pulling them
through (fig. 4).</p>

<div id='i047'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i047.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 4.—SHORTENING REINS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>It is far better on such an occasion to have
the reins rather too short than too long, but if
only a small amount of shortening is required
the right hand can be placed on the reins in
front of the left and the left hand slid up to
the right (fig. 5).</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Signal with whip to carriage behind.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When driving in a town, it is the rule to
swing the whip stick round once or twice as an
indication to the drivers of vehicles behind
you that you are going to slow down or turn
a corner.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Turn corners carefully.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Before coming to the turn the pace must
always be checked, particularly in a town,
where the streets are generally slippery and
there is nearly always a curbstone. Many
an accident occurs daily through corners being
negotiated carelessly. This advice appears
almost superfluous, but the reader will find
that to drive, even fairly broken horses, collectedly
round sharp turns requires great care
and precaution.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Starting a jibber.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In conclusion, it is worth pointing out, that
a horse which is inclined to jib, may often be
started either by turning him to one side with
the rein, or if this fails, by getting some one
to push him over. The reason is that he is
thus made to move before the pull comes on
his shoulders.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 5.—SHORTENING REINS BY SLIDING LEFT HAND<br />UP TO RIGHT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Fit of gloves.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The fit of the gloves may seem a very
trivial matter to the uninitiated, but it is not
considered such by the expert coachman.</p>

<p class='c004'>Any one attempting to drive with tight
“masher” gloves will find his hand cramped
in a very short time. All his power is taken
up in trying to keep his hand shut and wrestling
with his gloves, and not as it should be
in holding the reins tight.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is difficult in fact to have them too
large.</p>

<p class='c004'>They should be made of dogskin, and when
new, at least one inch longer than the fingers,
and rather larger, also very loose indeed across
the palm of the hand and wrist. They will
very soon shrink down and become the right
size, after the hand has got damp in them
once or twice.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is a good plan to punch a few round
holes in the back of the gloves to keep the
hand cool.</p>

<p class='c004'>The leather should be hard and tough, but
not too thick. Strapping inside is apt to make
gloves clumsy and very awkward for driving,
especially with four reins.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Woollen gloves.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Woollen gloves should always be carried, as
they are the most comfortable in wet weather,
and the reins do not slip through them.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Carriage rugs.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Never drive without a rug or apron of some
kind. A light cloth or cotton one may be
used in summer, but for the winter it is far
better to have a thick one of box cloth warmly
lined. When choosing an apron, remember
to get one with a V-shaped piece let in at the
top; this adds greatly to one’s comfort if
there are two people in the cart, as it allows
of the sides being tucked under, and thus
keeps out both cold and wet very much
better than one without the V let into it.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Hints on building dog-cart.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
A dog-cart is the handiest of two-wheeled
carts for all-round purposes, and therefore the
one in most general use; so that a few hints on
the selection or building of such a vehicle may
be of use to those who have not had much
practical experience in that line. At the
same time I would strongly recommend that
when buying a carriage of any kind professional
advice should, if possible, be obtained,
since no one without experience can possibly
find out faulty workmanship or detect defects
in the material.</p>

<p class='c004'>The following would be built for horses
about 15.2 in height:—</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Height of wheels.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The wheels should be fairly high, say about
five feet, as this enables the horse to pull the
cart over any small obstruction with greater
ease than with low wheels.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Track of wheels.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The track should be from five to five feet
three inches wide. This gives plenty of room
inside, and makes the cart less likely to upset.</p>

<p>FIG. 6.—DOG-CART.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Bent shafts.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Bent shafts are the most convenient for
driving horses of different heights, and should
be pivoted on the front part of the cart and
adjustable behind. A cart so constructed
will easily admit of horses from 14.2 to 16
hands being driven in the same vehicle.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Body of cart should be wide and low.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The body should be as wide as possible,
because nothing is more uncomfortable than
being cramped on a narrow seat. It also ought
to be low on the axle, thus rendering the cart
far more safe and also more comfortable.</p>

<p class='c004'>A fixed body is better than one that moves
backwards and forwards on the shafts, because
it always remains the same distance from the
horse, and enables the cart to be built lighter.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Seat of cart.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The seat should be low enough to prevent
the driver from feeling he is in want of a footstool
or that he is half standing, and should
slide in a groove out of which it cannot come
if the horse falls down. Many men have
been thrown out and had bad accidents simply
because of the seat coming away. It is moreover
more comfortable if slightly below the
top of the sides of the cart. The back and
front seats should be so arranged that the
cart will balance equally well with one person
or four—a result which can be arrived at by
having the seats to slide backwards and forwards
when more than two people are in
the cart.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Heath’s patent seat the best.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
I consider Heath’s patent the best
for this purpose; it is very light and effective.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Adjustable foot-rest necessary.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
If the seat is a sliding one, the driver must
have an adjustable foot-rest, and this can
easily be managed by having about half-a-dozen
pairs of holes in the floor of the cart for
the foot-rest to fit into. It should be a plain
board covered with indiarubber to prevent the
feet slipping, and tilted at an incline which
will keep the feet at right angles to the legs.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Bar foot-rest dangerous.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
A bar foot-rest is most dangerous, as the feet
may be easily caught under it in getting out
of the cart.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Position of lamps.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The lamps should be fixed
between the wheels and the sides of the cart,
care being taken that there is plenty of room
for them, so that should they get bent by any
accident they will not interfere with the
wheels. This position is much the best for
tandem driving; in any other position they
are continually catching the lash of the whip,
and are consequently a perpetual source of
annoyance.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Best trace attachment.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The best system of draught for a dog-cart
is that in which the traces are attached to a
swingle-tree, from the centre of which two
chains pass down to loops fixed to the axle
close to the inside of the wheels.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Swingle-tree.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The swingle-tree is held up by two straps
which pass through metal loops in the front
part of the cart. These straps should be
pretty strong; were they to break, the bar
would fall on the horse’s hocks and cause
an accident.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Chains on swingle-tree not to be too long.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Be careful that the chains are not too long,
and that the pull is really on them, and not as
is frequently the case entirely on the straps.
In the latter case of course the swingle-tree
ceases to be of any use.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Advantages of swingle-tree attachment.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The swingle-tree attachment enables the
horse to pull directly from the axle-tree by
means of the chains, and in this way the best
line of draught is obtained; moreover a certain
amount of play is given to the horses’ shoulders
and the chance of their galling is less
than with the ordinary method.</p>

<p>FIG. 7.—DOUBLE HARNESS ON HORSE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>To</span> drive a pair well, that is, to be able to
put-to and drive any two horses, is not such
an easy thing as at first sight it may appear
to the uninitiated. To drive a pair of good
goers thoroughly accustomed to their work,
and harnessed up in the right manner, is such
a very simple matter that the merest tyro
ought to be able to compete with it, with fair
success. But when he has two entirely different
and unknown animals to take in hand,
it is quite another question.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Belly-bands.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Double harness is fitted exactly the same
way as single, except that the belly-bands
should be slightly looser, so as to admit
two or three fingers between them and the
girths.</p>

<p class='c004'>We will suppose that the harness has been
put on the horses and correctly fitted to them,
and that they are standing in the stable ready
to be put-to; then the correct way of bringing
them out would be as follows:—</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How to lead horse out of stable.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The traces having been placed across his
back, the horse should be led out by the nose-band,
not by the rein or the bar of the bit,
otherwise the groom is very apt to job him in
the mouth without intending to do so, a
performance to which he may object and run
violently back, or rear up and fall over. Great
care should be exercised when leading out of
the stable. It not infrequently happens
that horses hit their hips against the walls,
which is liable to chip them, and cause
lameness, besides teaching them the extremely
bad habit of rushing out of the stable-door.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Hooking in alongside of pole.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Bring the horse carefully up alongside of
the pole, so that he does not hit either the
pole or the bar, and at once insert the hook of
the pole chain into the ring of the kidney link
of the hames, to prevent his running back on
to the splinter bar.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now place the outside trace on the roller
bolt, and afterwards fix the inside one. The
quicker the latter is done with uncertain
horses or kickers the better, as this operation
renders it necessary to reach right over
behind their quarters. If only one horse
is likely to kick, he should be put in first,
to avoid this danger. When taking out the
exact reverse should always be adhered to.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Polling up.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Never pole up the horses too tightly, as it
is very uncomfortable for them, more especially
with a team, when the pole is a heavy
one, because if the pole chains are tight the
weight of the pole will be always resting on
their necks. See that the end of the hook on
the chain is pointing downwards, as otherwise
a horse with a bar across the bottom of his
bit may get caught in it.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Pole pieces.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> For ordinary pair work leather pole pieces
are commonly used instead of chains. They
do not require so much cleaning, and are
much less trouble. They must be made of
strong leather and kept soft with dubbing or
salad oil, otherwise they may become rotten
and dangerous.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Adjustment of coupling reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The correct adjustment of the two short inside
reins, called coupling reins, requires great
care. They should be so fitted that an even
pressure is brought on both sides of the horses’
mouths, and in such a way also that both
horses shall go straight and pull evenly on
the traces (fig. 8).</p>

<div id='i065'  class='figcenter id003'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 8.—COUPLING REINS PROPERLY FITTED—HORSES’ HEADS STRAIGHT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>With a view to this the outer reins have a
number of holes punched in them, up and
down which the buckles of the coupling reins
can be shifted, thus enabling them to be
shortened or lengthened to suit each particular
horse’s mouth.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>To prevent a horse carrying his head to one side.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
For instance, if the near horse carries his
head to the near side, the coupling rein on the
off side should be taken up, when his head
will be straightened. At the same time it
must be borne in mind that if a coupling rein
is let out the effect is also produced of shortening
up the outer rein on the same side,
and thus bringing the horse on that side
further back than the other.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>To make horses which carry their heads in different ways pull
level.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Supposing we have two horses apparently
well matched, but that the near horse carries
his head rather out to the front and has a
light mouth, while the off horse has a hard
mouth and carries his head close in to his chest.
Now to get this pair to pull equally on the
traces we must obviously have the near
horse’s reins considerably longer than those
of the off horse. If they have been put to
with the coupling reins of equal length, both
buckled in the centre holes, there will then be
three or four holes on each side of the buckles,
and the reins can either be let out or taken
up (fig. 9).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>In this case we should begin by letting out
the off side coupling rein two holes, and
taking up the near-side rein the same number
(fig. 10).</p>

<p class='c004'>Then as the near horse has a light mouth,
he should be put on the cheek, and the hard-mouthed
pulling off horse on the middle bar.
This fitting will probably suit the horses,
and the pull on all four traces will be even.</p>

<p class='c004'>The reins will now be adjusted like those in
fig. 10, which shows how the near horse is able
to hold his head well in front of the other,
while the collars are brought level.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Coupling reins must not be too tight.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The most general fault is coupling up both
reins too tightly, which makes the horses
carry their heads in towards the pole, instead
of going quite straight, as they should do.
To prevent horses acquiring this habit, it is a
good plan occasionally to change their positions,
instead of always driving them on the
same side of the pole.</p>

<p>FIG. 10.—OFF-SIDE COUPLING REIN FITTED FOR HORSE<br />WHICH POKES HIS NOSE, NEAR COUPLING REIN FITTED<br />FOR HORSE WHICH CARRIES HEAD IN CHEST.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>This fault is very often to be seen in the
leaders of a team, keeping them close together,
and causing them to rub up against
each other to such an extent that they sometimes
chafe.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>To alter length of rein without interfering with coupling rein.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It is a convenience, particularly when breaking
young horses, to have more than one hole
in the billets for buckling the reins on the
bits, so that a horse can be pulled back or let
out a hole on either side without altering the
coupling rein.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>To prevent horses leaning against the pole.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Horses in a pair sometimes get into the
trick of leaning in against the pole, particularly
when going down hill.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is a difficult habit to cure them of, and
perhaps the best preventive is a good cut
with the whip when they first attempt it,
though a little furze or a bit of hedgehog skin
on the pole is sometimes effective.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Reins must not be allowed to slip.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The reins must never be allowed to slip
through the fingers of the left hand, nor under
any circumstances should the off rein be taken
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Right rein never be taken out of left hand.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
out of the left hand in order to turn to the
right or pull across the road.</p>

<p class='c004'>The right hand should pull the rein towards
the centre of the body, and not out to the
side to which you wish to go.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>To prevent collar galling the wither.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Sometimes a horse gets galled by the collar,
from being continually pulled up, or from
holding back down steep hills; this can be
remedied by having a tinned iron plate fitted
on under the top of the collar, without taking
the horse out of work.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Length of traces.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It will be found that traces usually stretch
and become of unequal length; when this
occurs, the shorter trace should be put on the
inside, and should be marked, so that it shall
not be put on the outside by mistake. With
some horses it will be found necessary to
have the inside trace half a hole or even
one hole shorter than the outer one, so as to
obtain an equal pressure on both sides of the
collar.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Bearing straps.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> If bearing straps for the traces are used
they should be just long enough to keep them
in a straight line; if longer, they will jump up
when the horse goes into his collar.</p>

<p class='c004'>Further instructions for his guidance in
driving a pair the reader will find in the
chapter on driving four horses.</p>

<p class='c004'>Breaks are so commonly used in India, that
a few hints may prove useful.</p>

<p class='c004'>As a rule those in use are so low that the
horses’ quarters are in front of the footboard
instead of being under it, and the driver is
consequently too far from his work. In
modern breaks the driving seat and boot are
built almost exactly like those of a coach,
where the footboard is well over the horses’
quarters. That portion of the footboard
which comes over the roller bolts should be
about five feet from the ground, which gives
room for the horses underneath.</p>

<p class='c004'>The inside seats should be at least six feet
long, so as to take four people comfortably
on each side; a second seat behind the
driving seat as on a coach can be added, and
if necessary can be made removable. This
gives three extra seats looking to the front,
the occupants of which will not suffer so much
from the dust as if they were inside.</p>

<p class='c004'>The body can be hung on four elliptical
springs, with a cross spring on the hind axle,
or on two elliptical springs in front with two
side springs and a cross spring behind. The
latter method is to be preferred.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Break measurements.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The approximate dimensions are as follows

  <h2 id='ch04' class='c007'>CHAPTER IV <br /> <br /> CURRICLE AND CAPE-CART.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>When</span> it is desired to drive a pair, but owing
to the expense, lack of carriage accommodation,
or other reasons, the purchase of an extra
carriage is inconvenient, an ordinary dog-cart
can be fitted with a pole and adapted for a
pair of ponies or horses at a very small cost.
In such a case however the pole of the dog-cart,
having nothing to support it with the
ordinary double harness, would fall to the
ground, and it would therefore be necessary to
adopt one of the two following methods of
draught:—</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Curricle.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> 1. That known as Curricle, in which a bar
passing from one horse to the other over the
pads supports the pole by means of a strap or
brace.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Cape-cart.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> 2. The system employed in what is generally
known as the Cape-cart, in which the
supporting bar passes through a ring near the
end of the pole, and is held up by straps
passing over the horses’ necks.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first of these systems is the smarter in
appearance, while the other is more suitable
for rough work. I will begin by discussing
the Curricle.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Cost of curricle.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
An ordinary dog-cart which has removable
shafts can be fitted with the requisite gear,
including the curricle bar and the pole chains,
for about £10. The necessary alterations
were made to my own dog-cart by Messrs.
Heath of Aldershot, who had originally built
it, but with no idea at the time it was made of
having a pole eventually fitted to it. I found
that it worked admirably from the first, and
no subsequent alterations or repairs were
necessary, there being in fact nothing at all
likely to get out of order.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How to fit dog-cart with a pole.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
To adapt the cart for pole draught, a large
square iron loop must be fixed under the
front of the cart, and a smaller one under the
centre. The latter loop must be very strong
and firmly fixed, as it has to take the extreme
end of the pole, which at times puts on
it a very great amount of strain.</p>

<p class='c004'>An extra board will therefore probably
have to be fitted right across the bottom of
the cart, the ordinary boarding of which the
bottom of a dog-cart is usually made being
too thin and flimsy to resist the strain which
the pole loop will put on it. Should this
loop tear out, or the board to which it is
fixed give way, a very serious accident may
occur.</p>

<p class='c004'>The pole must of course fit both loops
accurately, and it must be secured in them by
a bolt passing through it and preventing it
from being drawn out.</p>

<div id='i077'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i077.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 11.—POLE FITTED WITH SPRING FOR CURRICLE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Underneath the pole at the point where the
supporting strap will come there should be a
strong spring (fig. 11), which will do away with
much of the jar on the pole itself, and also on
the backs of the horses; and if it is likely that
a team of four will be driven, the pole should
be made with a hook at the end to take the
swingle bars.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Bars for attaching traces.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
For the attachment of the traces two bars
must be provided for, and as the front of the
cart will be too narrow for these to be fixed to
it direct, iron stays projecting about six inches
to either side can be screwed on underneath
each end of the front of the cart. The bars
can then be fixed to these stays by bolts
passing through their centres. The bars
will then revolve on their centres and give
the horses’ shoulders plenty of play, enabling
them to do their work with much
comfort.</p>

<p class='c004'>To the dog-cart itself no other alterations
are necessary. The addition of the pole does
not affect the balance to any appreciable
extent.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Difference between curricle and ordinary double harness.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
With regard to the harness, the chief difference
between curricle and ordinary double
harness is in the pads.</p>

<p class='c004'>These must be strong and heavy, and fitted
with special roller bolts, on which the steel
curricle bar rests (fig. 12). They require to be
heavy and strong, because at times the pole
will put a considerable weight on them, more
particularly when going down hill.</p>

<div id='i079'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i079.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 12.—CURRICLE BAR AND ROLLER BOLTS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>On each side they have a leather loop like
those on a tandem pad, and through these
the traces are passed. In the bolts on the
top of the pads is pivoted a small steel roller.
The curricle bar rests on the rollers, and by
their action is enabled to work freely from
side to side, or from one horse towards the
other, without any friction or noise. The
rollers can be raised or lowered about a
couple of inches, so that should the horses
be of unequal height the bar can be levelled
by raising or dropping one end of it.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Curricle bar.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The bar should be made of steel, and must
be long enough to give at least six inches
play to the outside of each pad when the
horses are standing square in their places.
It has a small screw at each end, on which
are screwed flat circular nuts to prevent the
bar dropping out of the bolts and off the
rollers. These are put on immediately the
bar has been passed through the bolts, and
are themselves secured and prevented from
coming unscrewed by V-shaped steel ties,
which pass through slits at the extreme ends
of the bar. In the centre of the bar is a long-shaped
loop or slit, through which the brace
or supporting strap is passed (fig. 12).</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Supporting strap or brace.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This brace should be a strong leather strap
about three inches wide. It passes under
the spring below the pole, through the slit in
the bar, and is fastened by a large double
buckle.</p>

<p class='c004'>The traces are the same as for single harness.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How to prevent pole tipping up.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
To prevent the pole from tipping up when
the weight is on the back of the cart, a
light strap, with a double buckle at each end
of it, can be fastened to the end of the girth-strap
of one of the pads under the horse,
passed over the pole, and again buckled at
the other end to the other horse’s girth-strap.
This is an effectual remedy for the tilting up
of the pole, even when a heavy man mounts
suddenly on to the back seat. In all other
respects the harness is the same as ordinary
double harness.</p>

<p class='c004'>If the cart is fitted with a swingle bar
for single harness, the steel chains which
connect the bar to the axle can perfectly
well be used as pole chains, in which case
it would be unnecessary to purchase new
ones.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ponies of fourteen hands or upwards, which
would look too small for a full-sized dog-cart
in single harness, and would be unable owing
to its weight to draw it, look extremely well
and make little of the weight when driven as
a pair, and can thus be utilized in curricle
when perhaps their services in harness would
otherwise be lost.</p>

<p class='c004'>A team of horses, or better still of ponies,
can also be driven in the poled dog-cart, provided
that the pole has the hook referred to
before at the end of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Four horses look altogether too big, and
the team is too long for the short cart behind
it; but a team of ponies, although they also
look rather too long, are very much better;
and the slight disadvantage of appearance
is well counterbalanced by the pleasure of
driving them, and by the ease with which
long distances can be covered without distress.</p>

<p class='c004'>Given a good, comfortable, roomy dog-cart
and four fairly-trained ponies which are really
fit, and no more enjoyable way of travelling
about a country can be found for two, three,
or even four people. The weight to be drawn
is so small compared to the horse-power employed,
that all hills can be surmounted at a
rapid pace, and long distances can be covered
in a single day, without placing any undue
strain on the cattle.</p>

<p class='c004'>The bars, though considerably lighter, are
exactly like the bars of a coach, while the
leaders’ harness, it is hardly necessary to
remark, is precisely the same.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Cape-cart.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In the Cape-cart, about eighteen inches
from the end of the pole, comes a supporting
bar or yoke, sometimes called a bugle, the use
of which is to prevent the pole from falling to
the ground. This bar, usually made of lance
wood, about an inch in diameter, and five feet
long, can be attached to the pole in several
ways, but it is best so to arrange it that it can
slide up and down the pole as well as from
side to side. Perhaps the best and simplest
attachment is obtained by passing a short
strap with brass rings at each end of it round
the pole, and then putting the yoke through
the rings. The middle of the yoke ought to
be covered with leather, to prevent it being
chafed by the pole.</p>

<p class='c004'>Though collars can be used, breast harness
is nearly always employed, and is much to be
preferred on account of the breeching being
much more effective than with collars; without
a breeching the horses are apt to come
back on to the splinter bar.</p>

<p class='c004'>Neither cruppers nor pads are essential.</p>

<p class='c004'>The breast harness is held up by straps which
pass through the same pads as the yoke
straps.</p>

<p class='c004'>These latter are fixed near the middle of

Messrs. Atkinson and Philipson of Newcastle-on-Tyne
make a speciality of this kind
of harness.</p>

<p class='c004'>A dog-cart can be adapted for the Cape-cart
draught in exactly the same manner as
previously described for curricle; the pole,
however, should be rather longer.</p>

<p class='c004'>Advocates of the Cape-cart claim the following
advantages for it over the Curricle:
that specially constructed heavy pads are not
required, and that should one horse fall, there
is very slight chance of his bringing down the
other with him.</p>

<p class='c004'>These two styles of draught are much used
abroad, the latter in India, where it is known as
“Tonga,” the former in South Africa, whence
it derives its name. As far as utility goes
there appears to be little between them.</p>

<p>FIG. 16.—FOUR WEIGHTS AND PULLEYS FOR PRACTISING DRIVING.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Practice with weights.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
For driving, like so many other accomplishments,
requires to be kept up, or else
the hand and eye will very soon be found to
have lost their cunning, and not only does
one become slow and clumsy with the whip
and reins, but the arms and fingers soon tire.
In order to keep the hand in, when not
driving regularly, an arrangement of weights
and pulleys is a very convenient toy. It
requires a weight of about twenty pounds (a
cylinder of lead is very handy), to which is
attached a strong cord. This passes over
pulley <span class='fss'>P</span> (fig. 15), fixed for convenience to
the mantelpiece or other projection from the
wall, down to pulley
 <span class='fss'>P<sup>1</sup></span>,
on the floor, and
then ends in a loop, into which four straps
can be fastened like reins. Then sitting in a
comfortable chair, the hands holding the
straps like reins, the weight can be kept
working up and down (four or five inches will
be found quite sufficient) for ten minutes or
so. Another method, which is rather more
complicated, but more useful for the beginner,
is shown in fig. 16. This, while strengthening
his arms and fingers, enables him to
acquire the art of looping and shortening the
reins, and in fact to practise all the tricks of
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Arrangement of pulleys and weights.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the trade. For this practice eight pulleys
are required; four are fixed on the wall, about
three or four feet from the ground and from
three to six inches apart; the other four are
placed directly under these, and fixed to the
floor close up against the wall. A strong
cord is passed under each lower pulley first,
then over the pulley directly above, the ends
being fastened to weights of four or five
pounds. To the other ends of the cords are
attached leather straps similar to ordinary
reins. Thus you have four reins, the two
inner ones representing the wheelers, the two
outer ones the leaders.</p>

<p>FIG. 15.—PRACTISING DRIVING WITH THE WEIGHTS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Weight on hands when driving four horses.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It has been found by trial that the
approximate weight on the hands when
driving a light team is about five pounds, but
the average weight may be taken as about
ten or twelve pounds, which will be much
increased with a team of pullers; while going
down a steep hill the pressure will not infrequently
exceed thirty-five pounds. These
pressures, which I ascertained after many
experiments, will show the novice how all-important
it is that he should be really fit,
and the muscles of his arms and fingers well
developed, before he can hope to be really
master of a team of horses.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is always advisable, while practising with
weights, to hold a whip, or stick to represent
a whip, in the right hand, as by so
doing you will very soon get into the way of
using this hand correctly on the reins (fig. 15).</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Muscle of thumb necessary for holding whip.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It is very important for the young driver
to develop the muscle of the thumb; otherwise
it will be found extremely tiring to hold
the whip properly for any considerable time,
more especially against a high wind.</p>

<p class='c004'>Messrs. Whippy and Steggall have shown
me a very neat arrangement of weights and
pulleys which can be easily fitted up in any
room, and is well worth inspection.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Position of body on driving seat.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When driving, the body should be kept
upright and square to the front, but all stiffness
should be avoided. The driving seat
should be low, and about three or four inches
higher at the back than in front, so that the
driver can sit down in a really comfortable
position. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Position of legs.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The ankles and knees should be just
touching each other, and the arms close to the
sides, the point of the elbows touching the
hip bone. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Position of arms.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The forearm should be about
horizontal, and the left hand from three to four
inches from the centre of the body, the back
of the hand being turned towards the front
and nearly vertical, but inclined a little towards
the horses. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Position of left wrist.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The wrist must be bent slightly
towards the body, and on no account allowed
to bend the other way. This is far the best
position for feeling the horses’ mouths, as the
wrist then acts like a spring, and a perfectly
even pressure can be maintained. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Leaning forward bad.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Sit well

<p class='c008'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How to hold reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> <span class='sc'>The</span>
best way of holding the reins is to have

the middle and the third finger (fig. 17)
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Thumb and forefinger must not hold the reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> .
The reins must be gripped firmly by the three lower

to the right, and the forefinger be held well
out. The near lead rein should pass over or
close to the knuckle of the forefinger, and not
over the first or second joint. The beginner
will find that after a time the muscle at the
base of the left thumb will develop wonderfully,
and that the reins will be held between
this muscle and the lower fingers very firmly
without any apparent effort.</p>

<p>FIG. 17.—FOUR-IN-HAND—HOW TO HOLD REINS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Adjusting length of reins in hand.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
There are various ways of adjusting the
reins, either by pulling them out or pushing
them back from the front, or by pulling them
from behind, or by taking out the lead reins.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Shortening reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
One general principle as to shortening the
reins is to do it by putting the right hand in
front of the left, and pushing those required to
be shortened through the left hand. In doing
this the thumb should never be used, as it is
fully occupied in holding the whip. But the
beginner will very often find it easier to shorten
the reins from behind by pulling them
through the left hand. In this case the thumb
and forefinger must be used. I consider the
following the easiest and most effective ways
of adjusting the reins, viz.:—</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>To shorten all four reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
All four reins can be shortened, if much is
required, by pulling them through from behind,
but it is generally quicker and neater to
hold the reins with right hand two or three
inches in front of left (the little and the third
fingers over the off-side reins and middle
finger between the near-side reins), and then
slide the left hand up to the right. By this
means a perfectly steady pressure is kept
on the horses’ mouths. This movement is
generally required when going down hill.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>To shorten both wheel reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>Both wheel reins.</i>—It is better to shorten
these by pulling them through from behind.
This is necessary when going down steep
hills, especially when the wheelers are loosely
poled up, so as to prevent the bars hitting
the leaders’ hocks.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>To shorten both lead reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>Both lead reins.</i>—In order to shorten these
take out both the leaders with the right hand
(the third and little fingers over off, and first
or middle finger over near-side rein); you can
then pass them back to your left hand the
required length by letting them slide through
the right hand the necessary amount. To
lengthen them, simply pull them through from
the front.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Shortening near-lead rein.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>The near lead.</i>—Either push through from
the front, with the full of the right hand over
the rein, or take it right out of the left hand
the same way and replace it the proper
length.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Shortening off lead rein.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>The off lead.</i>—Push through from the front.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Shortening near wheel.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>The near wheel.</i>—This rein will be found
the most difficult of all to keep in its right
place and to shorten. It constantly slips
when the horses pull, and for beginners it is
certainly the best plan to pull it through from
behind. It can also be done by lengthening
out the off-lead rein from the front, and then
pushing both reins back together.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Shortening off wheel.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>The off wheel.</i>—Push it through from the
front with the right hand.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Shortening centre reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> <i>T
he two centre reins.</i>—Always adjust them
from the front. If the leaders are not straight
in front of you, which will be found a very
common occurrence, but are running to the
right, they will generally come straight by
pulling the two centre reins through the left
hand from the front, so as to lengthen them a
little; on the contrary, if the leaders are
running to the left, push these two reins back
so as to shorten them.</p>

<p class='c004'>If, however, they are going to the right or
left simply because you are holding the off
or the near-lead rein too short, let out this
rein only, just enough to bring the leaders
square.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Passing off across road.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The following are probably the easiest and
most effective methods of passing off across
the road, or of turning to the right or
left:—</p>

<p class='c004'>1. <i>To the left.</i>—Turn the left-hand knuckles
upwards, and pass it across the body from
left to right; the horses will incline to the
left, the reins on that side being shortened.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>To the right.</i>—Pass the left hand down
towards the left hip, back of the hand to the
front, with the knuckle of the forefinger downwards
and that of the little finger uppermost;
this shortens the right-hand reins and causes
the team to incline in that direction. The
whip can be applied to the off wheeler in the
first instance, or the near one in the second,
in front of the pad, if the horses do not cross
rapidly enough.</p>

<p class='c004'>2. <i>To the left.</i>—With the right hand seize
the near-lead and wheel reins under the lower
fingers; then either pull those reins up towards
the centre of the body, which will shorten
them, or allow the left hand to go slightly to
the front, which will slack off the right reins,
or better still, combine both these motions,
the result being the same in each case, that
the team will go to the left.
<i>To the right.</i>—Take hold of the off-lead
and wheel reins with the lower fingers of the
right hand, and treat them in the same way as
described for the left reins, when the team will
go to the right.</p>

other only being possible with very perfectly

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>To steady the team.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In order to steady the horses or to ease the
left hand, the right hand may be placed in
front of the other over all the four reins (fig. 18),
but it is generally preferable to have the hand
on only three reins for steadying purposes, the
third and little fingers being over the off reins
and the upper fingers over only one of the
near reins.</p>

<p>FIG. 20.—LOOPING NEAR-LEAD REIN UNDER THUMB.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The point or loop.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It will now be necessary to explain the
term “point” or “loop.” The point is made
by taking hold of either the near or the off-lead
reins under the little and third fingers of
the right hand (not with the forefinger and
thumb), and placing it six inches or more
(according to the inclination of the turn),
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Loop under thumb.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
in advance of the left, and then bringing it
back so as to form a loop under the left thumb
(figs. 20, 21), which must press the rein firmly
down on the forefinger. As a rule never move
the left hand forward while doing this. The
off-lead rein can also be looped under the first
finger in turning to the right (fig. 22).</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 22.—LOOPING OFF-LEAD REIN UNDER FIRST FINGER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Turning to either side can be done as
follows: By pointing the near leader to turn
to the left (fig. 20), or the off leader to turn
to the right (fig. 21); or, by pointing both the
near-lead and the near-wheel reins together to
go to the left, and similarly both the off-side
reins together to go to the right, at the same
time striking the opposite wheeler with the
whip in front of the pad after the point has
been made, if the horses are required to move
in either direction very quickly; or, by passing
the near-wheel rein round the left thumb,
and then looping the off-lead under the forefinger (fig. 22),
it will be found that the horses
will get more easily round a very sharp and
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Turning an awkward corner.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
awkward corner to the right, especially going
down hill. In a like manner, by looping the
off-wheel rein under the forefinger of the left
hand, and then pointing the near leader under
the thumb, any difficult turn to the left can
be negotiated with perfect safety. This method
will often be found quicker and better than
passing the off-wheel rein under the thumb.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Meaning of opposition point.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This looping up of the wheeler’s rein on
the opposite side to which you are about to
turn may be termed the “Opposition point.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This device for preventing the wheelers
from cutting the corners will be found most
useful with horses that have been driven a
great deal in the wheel, because they soon
learn to recognize the indication given to the
leaders by the shortening of the lead rein
passing along close to their heads.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 23.—RIGHT HAND ON OFF-SIDE REINS TO PREVENT WHEELERS CUTTING CORNER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Very often, when the wheelers are boring
to one side going down hill, and the whip is
required, it is useful to loop up the wheeler’s
rein on the opposite side to which they are
boring, before using the whip.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Do not lean forward when looping.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Be careful, when stretching out the right
hand in order to take up the lead rein to loop
it, not to lean the body forward, as it looks
very bad, and almost invariably shows that
the left hand is holding the reins too short
and is too far away from the body.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is a common fault with beginners to
stretch out the left hand when looping, thus
taking up a larger loop than would be necessary,
if the left hand had a proper hold of the
horses’ heads.</p>

<p class='c004'>The loop once made should not be allowed
to slip until the turn is completed.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Prevent wheelers cutting corners.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The right hand, having once caught up the
loop, and given the leaders the office which
way to turn, is then free to be used in any of
the following ways: to seize both the off-side
reins, if turning to the left, to prevent the
wheelers from going too quickly round the
corner (fig. 23); to assist them, if not turning
sharply enough, by catching hold of the near-side
reins; to do just the opposite if turning
to the right; or finally to use the whip on
either of the wheelers, by hitting the outside one
to make them come round more quickly, or the
inside one to prevent them cutting the corner.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Looping a second time, when first loop not enough.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
More than one point can be made, if a
large enough loop has not been taken up at
first, but usually one point is sufficient,
enough rein being taken up the first time to
complete the turn.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sometimes at a very sharp corner two
points are necessary, as you may find that the
first one is not bringing the leaders round
fast enough.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Opposition point to right.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The opposition point to the right is made
by putting the near-wheel rein round the left
thumb, passing it from inside from right to
left, and then making the point with the off-lead
rein under the forefinger (fig. 24). When
once round, first let go the point of the leader,
and then that of the near wheeler.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Opposition point to left.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Conversely, the opposition point to the left is made by putting the
off-wheel rein under the forefinger of the left hand, and then
pointing the near-lead rein under the thumb (fig. 25). In order to
avoid having two reins looped up under the thumb, it seems better to
use the forefinger for one of the loops and the thumb for the other;
in this manner either loop can be let go separately.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Shortening reins going down hill.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It should hardly ever be necessary to
shorten the lead reins when going down hill,
as the mere fact of the wheelers coming back
out of draught to hold back the coach will
make you shorten up the reins enough to
bring the leaders out of draught at the same
time. If anything, it will be found necessary
to shorten the wheel reins, more especially if
the hill is very steep and the wheelers are
loosely poled up.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Leaders out of draught going down hill.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Going down hill the leaders should just
carry the bars, and nothing more. They
should not put any strain at all on the pole,
for by doing so they obviously tend to
counteract the efforts of the wheelers to keep
back the coach. In order to carry the bars
the traces should be slack, but not slack
enough to let the whole weight of the bars
weigh down on the pole, which would put so
much extra weight on the wheelers’ necks.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Leaders must not pull on pole when turning.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Be careful that the leaders are not straining
on the pole when turning a corner, as otherwise
the wheelers will inevitably be pulled
sharply across on to the pavement or footpath,
and the pole may be broken.</p>

</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How to hold whip.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sc'>You</span> must learn to play with the whip neatly,
and to be able to use it skilfully on any of the
horses. The handle should rest in the palm
of the right hand, and be kept firmly in its
place by the action of the thumb pressing
against the base of the forefinger; the lower
fingers will then be left free to catch hold of
the reins.</p>

<p class='c004'>If, however, it is necessary to pull the reins
through from behind, the lower fingers must
be tightened on the handle so as to allow the
thumb and forefinger to be used.</p>

<p class='c004'>Always take care that the whip is in its
right place, and the thong properly done up.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Angle of whip.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Hold the whip at an angle of about thirty
degrees to the left front and about forty
degrees upwards, and not as in the picture
opposite (fig. 26).</p>

<p class='c004'>The thong ought to have three or four turns
round the stick, the first turn beginning close
to or on the quill, which is always covered
with black twine.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>No kinks in lash.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Pay special attention to holding the whip
so that the double thong hangs straight down
and has no kinks in it. If there should be
any kinks they can be taken out by adding a
turn or two on the stick, or by taking some
off.</p>

<p class='c004'>Do not hold the whip tighter than is absolutely
necessary. In fact, when the hand is on
the reins the grip may be released altogether
for a time, as they will hold it up; this will
give the thumb a rest. Holding it loosely
also ensures the double thong hanging straight
down, as then it will do so by reason of its
own weight. It looks excessively bad to see
the whip held all sideways, but it will constantly
get into that position unless the tyro
pays great attention to keeping it straight.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Lash of whip under thumb.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The point of the lash should be just under
the inside of the thumb; this will keep it from
slipping. Hold the whip where it balances
comfortably, the end of the stick close to, and
under the forearm, the wrist well bent, and
the elbow close to the side.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Position of whip hand.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When the right hand is not on the reins or
using the whip, it should be kept close to the
left, the forearm being about horizontal. It
can then rest on the thigh, and yet be ready
for any emergency.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Balance of whip.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
A good whip should balance well when
held at or close to the collar (this should come
nearly under the thumb), otherwise it will
be found top-heavy and clumsy.</p>

<p class='c004'>The collar is the plate about ten inches from
the thick end of the stick, and is sometimes
termed the top ferrule.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Choice of whip.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In choosing a whip the most essential points
are: firstly, that it should balance as above;
secondly, that it should be fairly light and
springy—springiness being useful, because it
renders a whip very much easier to catch; and,
thirdly, that it should have some knots near
the top, as they materially assist in keeping
the thong up, though too many will be
found an impediment to getting it out
quickly.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How to catch thong of whip.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> A very good way to learn to catch the
thong neatly round the stick is this: chalk a
large pot-hook or <i>S</i> on the wall; stand opposite
to this with the whip held in the proper
position, the thong undone, and the point
of the lash under the middle finger of the
right hand, the forefinger rather pointed up
the stick (fig. 27); then with the point of the
whip quickly follow the line as traced on the
wall, beginning from the bottom end, and
moving it across from left to right; the
top part of the <i>S</i> should be done by a back
turn of the wrist, first upwards and then downwards,
which will bring the fingers uppermost
at the finish. Never let the point of the whip
drop at the beginning of the <i>S</i>, and never hit
at the thong, but on the contrary make it
come up to the stick. If you find that the
thong is caught rather too low down, it
can be very easily sent up higher by catching
it again as above, but with rather a shorter
and more jerky motion, in fact describing
a small <i>S</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Taking out loop in lash.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Having caught the thong (fig. 28), the next
thing to be done is to take out the loop which
will be found in the middle of the stick, so
that all the turns should be from right to left;
otherwise it will very soon come undone.
To do this, lower the stick so as to enable
the left thumb to seize the loop (taking care
not to move the left hand from its correct
position while doing so); now move the whip
hand out to the right front as far as possible,
keeping the wrist well bent and holding
the lash tight with the left thumb (fig. 29).
This movement will take off the turns on the
lower end of the stick. Now place the whip
under the left thumb, and turn the spare
end of the lash once or twice round the handle
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>End of lash round handle of whip.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> (fig. 30).
With the right hand retain the point
of the lash securely under the inside of the
right thumb, which will prevent the thong
getting loose. If the point slips up, it can be
pulled tight again by catching hold of it with
the left thumb and forefinger, and drawing
the right hand away.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How to keep lash pliant.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How to hit horses with whip.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The wheelers should be hit in front of
the pad to avoid making them kick. If ever
they should attempt to kick, a severe blow
about the ears will usually put a stop to
it. Generally move the whip from left to
right, keeping the wrist nearly stiff, and doing
it as far as possible from the elbow, without
any circular motion of the forearm. With a
fidgety near wheeler it is advisable to hit the
off one on the outside. It is no use hitting
the wheelers if the leaders’ reins are too long;
in this case you must first shorten up the
leaders’ reins, and then use the whip on the
wheelers; otherwise, as soon as the wheelers
have jumped into their collars, the leaders will
again press forward, and allow the wheelers to
hang back as before.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Hitting off leader.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The best way to hit the off leader is first to
bring the top of the whip from the near to the
off side of the coach; then undo the thong by
swinging the stick round and round, at the
same time keeping the point of the lash under
the first finger. Next bring the right hand
down close to the left, and place the left
thumb over the point of the lash so as to
keep it clear of everything. Now swing the
stick back to the right until the wrist is
about in line with the shoulder, at the same
time releasing the point from under the
thumb. This should be done with very little
movement of the wrist. Make a good circular
turn and bring the stick to the front again
sharply, aiming with the point a little in front
of the spot you wish to hit. In doing this the
lash can travel to the front either above or
below the stick, but in traffic, or when under
trees, the latter will be found the safer.</p>

<p class='c004'>The only place the point of the whip
should ever crack is on the horse, and never
under any circumstances in the air, which
would be dangerous, especially to those on
the back seat, besides being very unworkmanlike.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lash should hit the leaders under
the bars on their hocks, as it does not look
well to see wheals or streaks of mud on the
horses’ flanks and quarters.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Hitting near leader.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
To hit the near leader, begin as before, but
instead of making the lash go to the off side
of the coach, throw the right hand well up and
make a good swing with the stick, so that the
lash may go well over the heads of the
passengers from the off to the near side,
and then by dropping the point of the stick
and letting the hand go slightly out to the
front, it will be found that the lash will swing
in and hit the near leader, while passing outside
and avoiding the near wheeler’s head.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Bringing back lash.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Having once hit the leader, the lash should
be brought back on the near side of the coach.
Do not attempt to get it straight back to your
hand, otherwise you will most likely hit the
wheeler, or the passenger on the box seat, but
just send the lash out to the front over the
leaders with a circular motion, and then by
holding the stick nearly upright it will come
into your hand or under your arm (fig. 31).
This will leave the right hand free to steady the
horses, which will generally be found necessary.
The lash, having been brought back to the near
side of the coach, can also be recovered by
raising the whip vertically and bringing it over
the wheeler’s back. This, although a quicker
plan than the other, will not be found so easy
or so safe.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Hitting near leader under bars.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The near leader can also be hit from the
off side under the bars. To do this the lash
must be thrown outwards, away from the
coach, and then brought back swinging under
the stick, so that the point passes between
the off wheeler and the off leader just under
the end of the pole. This requires a considerable
amount of practice, otherwise the
off-side horses will often be hit by mistake.
Another very useful method is to throw the
lash between the wheelers’ heads, hitting the
leader on the quarter.</p>

<p>FIG. 31.—BRINGING BACK THONG OF WHIP AFTER HITTING A LEADER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Placing lash under thumb before catching up.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When once the lash has been secured under
the wrist or forearm, it can easily be placed
under the left thumb by bringing the right
hand down close to the left. Holding it firmly
in this position, draw the whip hand away to
the right front, keeping the wrist well bent,
and allowing the lash to slide through the
middle finger of this hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>This can be repeated until the point of the
lash has been pulled up into the right hand,
when the thong can be caught on the stick as
usual. If you catch the lash straight into the
right hand the point may be got hold of by
throwing the point of the stick upwards, and
allowing the lash to slide through the middle
finger. This is not nearly such a good plan
as that described above, for you may easily
throw the lash away altogether, and thus
have to catch it again. Be careful, when you
have the point of the lash in the right hand,
to see that the loop is well clear of everything
before catching it up on the stick, as it often
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>See that thong is not caught on footboard.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
gets caught round the handle of the footboard
or against the reins, which utterly spoils the
catch. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Never use whip when right hand on reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
You should never hit a horse with the
whip while the right hand is holding a rein;
it looks very awkward, and is most unworkmanlike.
Should you have a loop of a rein
in the right hand, as you might have when
going round a corner to the right, first place
the loop under the left thumb or forefinger,
and then use the whip.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>To release lash caught in harness.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
If when hitting a leader the lash should get
caught round the bars or harness, do not jerk
or pull it hard, but shake it loosely up and
down; otherwise it will most likely get caught
all the tighter.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Whip under thigh.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> If you want to use the right hand on the
reins while the lash is caught, place the
handle under the thigh and sit on it. Should
the whip get fast in the bough of a tree or a
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Lash caught in tree.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
lamp-post, on the near side, the only thing to
do is to let it go at once, letting your hand go
well up and over to the left. You will then
avoid hitting the passenger on the box seat.
Constant practice with the whip is absolutely
essential; no one can drive well until he
has thorough control over it, and is able to
manipulate it in such a way that the horse
struck is the only one which knows that it is
being used.</p>

  <h2 id='ch08' class='c007'>CHAPTER VIII <br /> <br /> FOUR-IN-HAND. STARTING—PULLING UP—TURNING.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Looking round before starting.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sc'>Before</span> starting have a good look round and
see that the horses are properly put in, that
the harness is correctly put on and fitted, and
more especially that the bits are rightly adjusted
and the reins put in the correct places.
Take care also that the pole-pin is in its
place. It is never safe to trust entirely to the
servants or ostlers.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Lead reins should never be buckled.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The lead reins should never under any circumstances
be buckled together; the reason
of this is that if the main bar gets broken, the
leaders will be able to pull the reins through
and get clear away. On road coaches it is
customary to leave both lead and wheel reins
unbuckled.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Preparing to start—taking up reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Place the whip neatly caught up in the
socket, if not already there. Standing alongside
of the off wheeler’s quarters, with the
right hand take hold of the leaders’ reins
without touching the horses’ mouths, and place
them in the left hand, the forefinger between
them; next take hold of the wheelers’ reins,
placing the middle finger of the left hand
between them, without pulling them so tight
as to feel their mouths.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then with the right hand pull out the
off-side reins twelve to eighteen inches, and
see that the splicing on the lead reins
and the buckles of the couplings in the
wheel reins are about the same distance
from the left hand. The reins will then
be about level when you are seated on the
box.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Transferring reins to right hand before mounting box.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Having done this, transfer the four reins to
the right hand, but one finger lower down
than they are held in the left; the first finger
will then be free to hold on to the footboard
whilst climbing up.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Mounting box seat.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In order to help yourself on to the box,
catch hold of the lamp wire with the left
hand, place the left foot on the pipe box of
the wheel, the right foot on the roller of the
splinter bar; then the left foot can be raised
on to the step and the right foot on to the
footboard.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Sit down at once when mounted.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Now sit down on the seat at once; otherwise
if the horses start off suddenly you may
be pitched off. Immediately transfer the reins
from the right hand back to the left, by passing
the fingers of the left hand just in front of
the fingers of the right, the forefinger of the left
hand being opposite the middle finger of the
right. Then adjust any rein not found to be
correct. It is always advisable to have a rug
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Rug or apron necessary.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> or apron over
your knees, as not only does it
look untidy to be without one, but it also
saves your trousers immensely, as the reins
are sure to touch them to a certain extent
and wear them out, especially in damp
weather. As soon as you have arranged the
reins satisfactorily in the left hand, being
especially careful not to have them too long,
take the whip out of the socket and keep it in
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Caution to passengers before starting horses.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the right hand. Before starting always give
the caution, “Sit fast,” or ask if “All right
behind?” as many a man has been jerked off
from not knowing that the coach was going
to start.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>To start horses.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> To start, feel all the horses’ mouths, and, if
necessary, give them the word to go, dropping
the hand to them at once until the coach is
fairly off. Nothing tends more to make
horses jib than holding on to their heads at
the moment of starting.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Wheelers start the coach.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The wheelers ought to start the coach, and this can be effected by
touching them with the whip if they require a hint. Do not, however,
on any account hit a wheeler which is inclined to jib, but make the
others get the coach moving.</p>

<p class='c004'>To be able to start horses well is perhaps
the most difficult thing which the young
driver has to learn. The knack can only be
acquired by experience, and no absolute rules
can be laid down for his guidance, as no two
teams are alike in temper and disposition.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before starting have the rugs taken off
quietly, not snatched off, and, as soon as you
are ready, make the grooms stand well clear
of the horses’ heads. Then start them as
quietly as possible, devoting all your skill to
getting the coach under weigh at once, without
pulling at the horses’ heads, as nothing
irritates horses so much, or is more apt to
make them jib, than jerking their mouths, or
having to pull up and start afresh. As soon
as they are well started, you can bring your
hand back a little and feel their mouths
properly. Then if you find that the horses
are not going straight you must re-adjust the
reins as quickly as possible; this is a most
difficult thing for a beginner to do neatly. It
is a good plan to start with the near-wheel
rein rather shorter than the off, as that is the
most difficult rein to shorten in a hurry.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Whip should be in the hand, ready for use at start.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It is never safe to start the coach without
having the whip in the right hand ready for
immediate use. The whip is to the driver
what the leg is to the rider, <i>i.e.</i>, it keeps the
horses up to their bits.</p>

<p class='c004'>As soon as the horses are going straight
take the right hand off the reins, at the same
time keeping it close by ready for any emergency.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Left hand must give and take.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> A great deal of the neatness in driving
depends on what may be termed the give and
take of the left hand. That is, it can be
allowed to go forward or be lowered a little,
or be pulled back close to the body; for
instance, in order to pull across the road to
the right, the right hand should pull the off
side reins, while the left hand at the same
time moves slightly to the front so as to slack
off the near-side reins. In this way both
hands do their share of the work, and an
exaggerated movement of the right hand is
rendered unnecessary. Much can also be
done by turning the back of the left hand
either up or down. The principal effect of
this is to shorten or lengthen the near-lead
rein, and so pull the leaders more or less
across the road.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Pulling up.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> When you want to pull up, shorten all the
four reins by passing the left hand up to the
right, or else by pulling all the four reins
through from behind as before explained;
then having the right forefinger on the near-lead
rein, the middle finger on the near
wheel, and the lower fingers of the right hand
on the off reins (see fig. 35), pull both hands
back towards the body, and if necessary lean
back a little. It is not easy to pull up exactly
square, as one wheeler will very often hang
back much more than the other. This can be
regulated by pulling rather harder with the
middle finger to keep the wheelers to the left,
or by pressing strongly with the lower part
of the hand, in order to keep them to the
right.</p>

<p class='c004'>Should the horses be getting the better of
you, and you find that you cannot stop them,
it will be found a great assistance to place
the right leg over all the four reins, as you
may then be able to stop them by the extra
power and leverage you gain by the position
of the leg.</p>

<p class='c004'>Having pulled up at the end of a stage,
professional coachmen always throw the reins
down with both hands outside the wheelers.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>When turning round, go slow.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
With plenty of room a coach can be
turned round at a considerable pace, but for
this a wide sweep must be taken.</p>

<p class='c004'>Unless there is at least twenty yards, remember
to go very slowly; otherwise the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Coach may lock and upset.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
coach may lock, and then nothing can save
it from overturning except the breaking of
the pole.</p>

<p class='c004'>In any case great care must be taken to
keep the wheelers well out and the leaders’
bars very slack. To do this it is well to put
on the opposition point, and take a large loop
in the leaders’ reins.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Turning in narrow road.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
If it is necessary to turn in a very narrow
road, it is generally better to take the leaders
out, but it can also be done in the following
manner:—</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Backing coach to enable turn to be made.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Pull off to the left side of the road as far as
possible, and then pull up to a walk; slant
the horses across the road to the right by advancing
a little, and then halt, pulling strongly
on the near reins so as to get the pole
across to the left; shorten up all the reins, and
with the little finger of the right hand on the
off-side reins, and the middle finger on the
near-wheel rein, pull back the horses, backing
the coach as far as circumstances will admit.
When again halted the coach ought to be at
right angles to the road. The leaders must
now be brought right round to the right, and
in order to do this it is usual to shake the off-lead
rein a little before taking up the loop,
otherwise the leaders may come back on to
the pole.</p>

<p class='c004'>The wheelers must be brought round after
the leaders, care being taken not to bring
them round too quickly, so as to lock the
fore-carriage. Turning to the left is done in
a similar manner. With unsteady horses it is
safer to take out the leaders, as they are apt
to be hit by the bars, or come back on the
pole.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Pull of right hand should be towards centre of body.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Always pull the reins that you take up
with the right hand towards the centre of the
body, and on no account let your hands move
across to the side to which you want the
horses to go. This rather appears to be the
natural tendency, but it must be overcome.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Turning corner without looping.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It is often unnecessary to loop when going
round a gentle curve, and it may be sufficient
to pull the lead rein with the right hand, and
then, while still retaining a slight bight in it,
to catch hold of the wheel rein on the same
side just below; by this means you pull both
the reins on the same side, but with greater
force on the lead rein than on the wheel.
This plan may also be adopted for slanting
across the road.</p>

  <h2 id='ch09' class='c007'>CHAPTER IX <br /> <br /> FOUR-IN-HAND. VARIOUS USEFUL HINTS—WHAT SPARE ARTICLES TO CARRY, ETC.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>The</span> beginner must not suppose that a team,
or for that matter even one horse, can be
driven with the left hand only; even the very
best of whips is obliged to have constant
recourse to the right hand, especially when
passing through traffic.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the same time, he must remember to
resist the temptation of keeping the right
hand permanently on the reins, nor should
it ever be employed like the coachman’s
hand in fig. 3, in holding on to a bight
of the off reins in order to keep the horses
straight.</p>

<p class='c004'>The team ought to run perfectly straight at
any time with the reins in the left hand only;
and as a continuous pressure of the right
hand is very liable to cause any one of the
reins to slip, especially the near wheel when
the horses are pulling, this practice is objectionable.
Of course if the left hand gets
tired, the right must come to its assistance,
and then it should be placed either on three
or all four reins (see figs. 18 and 35).</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Always keep a steady pressure on reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Mind and keep a good steady pressure on
the reins at all times, and keep the horses up
to that pressure with the whip. The most
common fault among amateurs is that they
do not hold their horses nearly tight enough
by the head. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Reins slipping a common fault.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Always have a good hold of
them, and above all things remember never
to let the reins slip through the fingers.
This is a constant cause of horses getting out
of hand, and pulling for a long way, when
they would otherwise have gone quite comfortably
after the first mile or so.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Resin or wax on gloves.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> To prevent the reins from slipping, if the
horses are pulling, and especially with new
gloves, it will be found very convenient to
put a little powdered resin or beeswax on
the fingers and palm of the hand.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Start slow.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> If you have time, always start slowly (at
first six or seven miles an hour); by adopting
this plan the horses will go more kindly,
and after a bit your arm and fingers will feel
much less tired than if you had started at a
rapid pace.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Right wrist well rounded when right hand on reins, back
inclined downwards.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is very important to keep the right wrist
well rounded when pulling the reins on either
side, and the back of the hand rather inclined
downwards.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Point of whip to be kept well up and to the front.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
By keeping the hand in this position it will
be found that the point of the whip is kept
well to the front and high up. If the back of
the hand is turned up at all, the whip is sure
either to cause considerable inconvenience to
the person on the box seat (fig. 26), or else to
hit the near wheeler close to his tail. This
will most probably make him swish it, and
if it should by any chance get over the
thong, the result may be disastrous to the
boot.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Team boring to one side—how to remedy.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
If the horses are all boring to the left, it is
no use simply pulling at the two off-side
reins with the right hand, but at once shorten
these reins in the left.</p>

<p class='c004'>This can be done either by shortening them
singly, or by catching hold of the two off-side
reins as usual, placing the forefinger over the
near lead, and the middle finger over the near
wheel, and then allowing the near-side reins
to slide a little through the fingers of both
hands, while still retaining a firm grip of the
off-side reins. Of course, however, only a
very little can be got out at a time by this
method.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another plan is to grip the reins tightly
with the right hand, the first two fingers over
the near-side reins, the lower fingers over the
off, and then to open the fingers of the left
hand, when the off-side reins can be pushed
through them by turning the lower part of
the right hand towards the left (see figs. 18
and 35).</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Never remove left hand from reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Never on any account take the left hand
out of the reins, even though the right may
be holding them firmly in front, as it is very
difficult to get the left hand back into its
place again with the reins in the right places.
Of course, if your fingers are numbed from
cold or from hard pulling, it will be necessary
to take the hand out and slap the fingers on
the thigh. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Taking leaders’ reins out with right hand.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But if the horses seem to be
going all anyhow, take the leaders out with
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Lead reins should seldom be removed from left hand.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the right hand, the little finger over the off lead,
and the first or second finger over the near lead
(fig. 32); then adjust the wheelers by letting
the rein which is too short slide gently
through the left hand, and replace the leaders.
If the reins are found to be too long, shorten
them all from behind. This plan should be
rarely resorted to, as it is a very bad habit to
perpetually fiddle with the lead reins.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Keep an eye always on horses.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Always keep an eye on the position of the
horses, and see that they are in their right
places, and that each is doing his fair share
of work.</p>

<p class='c004'>If any horse is out of his place, find out
the cause, and adjust the rein or use the whip
accordingly.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Grip tightly with third and little fingers to prevent reins slipping.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Always keep the left hand and elbow in
their proper positions, and keep a firm grip of
the reins with the third and little fingers
never on any account allowing one to slip.
This cannot be too strongly insisted on,
although it will be found very tiring at first,
even if the horses are not pulling.</p>

<p>FIG. 32.—TAKING LEADERS’ REINS OUT OF LEFT HAND WITH RIGHT HAND.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Do not drop left hand.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When catching or attending to the whip,
beginners are very apt to drop the left hand.
This leads to horses getting out of hand, and
makes them pull.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>When looping do not alter position of left hand.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Do not allow the left hand to go moving
across the body from side to side, or to
move to the front to pick up the
reins; except occasionally when turning
to the left, when it may be useful to loop
thus:—</p>

<p class='c004'>Hold the off-side reins under little and
third fingers of the right hand; then take
hold of the near-lead rein with the forefinger
some three inches away from left hand; and
holding it tight bring it up as much as
possible towards the body, at the same time
quickly passing the left hand down so as to
catch the near-lead rein in front of the right
forefinger with the left thumb; then bring
the left hand back to its original position,
and you have a good loop, and the wheelers
are checked from rushing the corner by the

the off reins.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Leader’s tail over reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
If one of the leaders gets his tail over the
reins, never pull at it, but, on the contrary,
slack it out. Pull the wheelers across to that
side on which the offender is running; then
hit the wheeler on the opposite side, on his
neck, when the movement of the wheelers to
one side will probably clear the rein.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Loosen rein fixed under tail by hitting horse.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Another plan for getting the rein out is to
slack it a good deal, and give the horse a sharp
hit with the whip behind the pad; this will
nearly always cause him to swish his tail,
when you can pull the rein quickly away.</p>

<p class='c004'>If both the above methods fail, stop the
coach at once, when a man must get down
and release the rein by lifting up the leader’s
tail, and not by pulling the rein away from
under it.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>To prevent leader getting tail over a rein.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
With a horse that habitually gets his tail
over the reins and then kicks, it is a good
plan to run the lead rein either through the
throat-lash, or the inside loop of the bearing-rein
of the wheeler which is on the opposite
side of the coach to the kicking leader.</p>

<p class='c004'>The reins can also be run through the head
terrets or loops on the top of the wheelers’
heads, but if this is done it is better to use a
bearing-rein, because, if the horse shakes his
head up and down, he will inevitably jerk the
leader in the mouth.</p>

<p class='c004'>These terrets have been almost entirely done
away with, as, if the leaders pull, they put a
great strain on the wheelers’ heads, and if the
latter throw their heads up and down to any
great extent, they continually jerk the leader’s
mouths, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Objection to lead reins passing through head terrets.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
whereas by passing the lead reins
through the ring on the throat-lash of the
wheeler there is almost a straight pull from
the leaders’ mouths to the terrets on the pads
of the wheelers.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Side reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Side reins are sometimes useful on leaders,
and have a good effect on hard-mouthed
horses.</p>

<p class='c004'>If on the outside, they should be fixed to
the buckle of the horse’s own trace, but on the
inside to that of the other horse.</p>

<p class='c004'>A very useful kind of side rein has a brass
ring sewn into one end of it instead of a
buckle; a short strap or loop is passed
through this ring and buckled to each side
of the bit, while the other end of the rein
is buckled to the inside trace of the other
horse.</p>

<p class='c004'>The ordinary rein used by the Artillery
Driver on his off horse will do equally well.
This consists of a long rein buckled to the
outside of the bit, and a short coupling piece
to the inside. If a horse pulls very hard and
tries to get in front of the other horse, either
of these reins will bring all the pull on to his
bit and keep him in his place.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Fitting coupling reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The leaders’ coupling reins should not be
made too long or else the horses’ tails may
get fixed in them—a position from which it
will be found that they are extricated with
difficulty. The buckles should come to
within six or eight inches of the top of the
leaders’ tails, which allows plenty of room
for taking up or letting out these reins.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>To prevent buckle of coupling rein getting fixed in terret.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Have a runner fixed about a foot below the
buckle on the rein, through which the coupling
should be passed; this will prevent any
chance of the buckle getting through the
terret. Messrs. Whippy and Steggall of
London have invented another simple device
to prevent this danger occurring. They place
a short steel plate, about five inches long,
covered with leather, and the same width as
the reins, between the rein and the coupling.
One end has a hole which passes through the
tongue of the buckle, and the other has a
runner on it, through which the coupling
passes, so as to admit of this rein being altered.
They also place two keepers on the rein just
below the buckle. By this means the steel
plate would be drawn across the terret and
the buckle could not possibly get through.
For the fitting of coupling reins the reader
must refer to Chapter III.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>To prevent wheelers cutting corners.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In order to prevent the wheel horses from
rushing too quickly round a corner, which
they very often try to do, it is usual to catch
hold either of both off or near-side reins
with the right hand, on the opposite side
to which you are turning, after having
looped.</p>

<p class='c004'>When looping a wheel rein for the opposition
point, take hold of the off rein from outside,
but the near rein from above the two off
reins.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Keep tight hold of horse’s head when hitting him.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When striking a horse be careful to keep a
tight hold of him, as the whole effect of the
punishment will be lost if the reins are slack
or are allowed to slip.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Buckles of wheel reins should be close to hands.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The buckles of the wheelers’ reins should
be well within reach, but should not be so far
up as to come into the hand when going
down a steep hill or when pulling up. A foot
from the hand when the horses are in draught
will be found to be about right.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Cruppers unnecessary except with bearing-reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Cruppers will be found quite unnecessary
as a general rule, more especially on the
leaders, but if bearing-reins are used, it is
almost imperative to have them on, in
order to prevent the pads being pulled forward
on to the withers, and so galling the
horses.</p>

<p class='c004'>Be careful not to have any spare end of
the crupper-strap hanging loose, or the lead
rein will be apt to get caught in it, and give
trouble. For this reason it is a good plan to
have the cruppers made martingale fashion, as
they have no spare ends, and only one runner
is required.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Reins should be of equal thickness.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Both lead and wheel reins should be
exactly the same width and thickness, and
should on no account be short. This is
extremely dangerous, as they might be easily
dropped. It is much better to have them
very long, but about two or three feet of
spare rein will usually be found sufficient.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Leaders flying apart.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When leaders are inclined to fly away from
each other, or one of them hangs outwards,
the inside traces should be lapped round each
other and hooked into their own bars. This
will help to keep the horses together. It is
not a good plan, though it is sometimes done,
to fasten the leaders’ bars together by a chain
as, if a horse kicks, and gets his legs fixed up
between the main bar and the others, it
becomes a very difficult matter to extricate
him.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Spare gear should be carried.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The following spare articles should always
be carried on a coach:—</p>

<p class='c004'>Two swingle-trees—one large and one
small.</p>

<p class='c004'>Two traces—one lead and one wheel.</p>

<p class='c004'>A jointed whip fixed up on a board. A
leather bag containing a hand punch with
assorted bits, and a McMahon spanner.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Brushing boots.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Brushing boots. Those made of fairly thick
blanket will be found the most useful. They
must be long enough to go right over the
fetlock and overlap, and should be fastened
round the middle with tape and be deep
enough for the upper part to be folded down
over the knot.</p>

<p class='c004'>Collar-pads—several leather ones are
required.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sheepskin—a good-sized piece.</p>

<p class='c004'>Needle and waxed thread.</p>

<p class='c004'>A few spare straps and buckles.</p>

<p class='c004'>A few cheek leathers.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>False collars.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> False collars, which can either be made of
leather or numnah, often come in very handy.
The advantage of the latter material over the
former consists in its being softer, and in the
event of a gall a piece can easily be cut
out; but, on the other hand, it requires a more
roomy collar.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Alter bits when team pulling.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
If the team are pulling too hard, stop
them occasionally and alter the bits. Lowering
these in the horses’ mouths often has a
wonderful effect. You can also tighten the
curb-chains, or put the reins lower down on
the bits. Do not pull at your horses more
than you can help, but directly you feel that
they are getting the best of you stop at once,
and if possible give them up to another
driver. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Pace should suit the slowest horse.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
If three of the team can go ten
miles an hour, and the fourth horse only
eight, keep the three back to the slow one,
for you cannot make him go up to the others
without galloping. When, however, you are
on a road coach, it is better to let the slow
horse gallop than to lose time.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Galloping.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Galloping should not be attempted by the
novice, for until he has learnt to take a good
steady hold of the horses’ heads it is really
very dangerous, not only on account of the
rapid pace, but because the coach will almost
certainly be set rocking in a very uncomfortable
manner, and may eventually be upset.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How to prevent coach rocking.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When a coach is found to be rocking, give
the leaders a little more rein, so that their
traces may place a more constant strain on
the pole, which will then be steadied. Then
take hold of the horses’ heads and slow down
gradually.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Horse’s likes and dislikes.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
If possible try and find out what a horse
likes and dislikes so as to avoid irritating
him. The sound of the horn annoys many
horses terribly, and makes them pull. Sometimes
this can be got over by constantly
blowing the horn in the stable. Some hate
the sound of the whip, so try and use it very
quietly. Others dislike the sound of heavy
carts rattling past them, and are in that case
best placed on the near side.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Judging pace.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> To become a really good judge of pace is
most difficult, but it is very important, and
can only be learned by constant and steady
practice.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Team wobbling.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> To drive neatly the horses must above all
things be kept going straight along the road,
with the wheelers exactly behind the leaders.
Always save your cattle as much as possible,
and to this end never let them wobble across
the road. In some teams this tendency to
wobble is great, and must be checked at once.
This can only be done by continually watching
them. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Coach wobbling, apply grease.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
One great cause of the coach
wobbling is the fore-carriage moving stiffly,
owing to grit or mud having found its way in
between the plates—a state of affairs which
can easily be remedied by a plentiful application
of grease.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Steering team like steering a ship.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Any such movement should be anticipated
in the same manner that a good helmsman
anticipates the swing of his ship, with a slight
motion of the rudder, as by so doing he is
never obliged to put his helm hard over. The
unaccustomed hand always waits too long,
till the ship has already swung, and then is
obliged to use a great deal of helm—the result
being that he makes his course into a series of
zigzags.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the same way a very slight pressure
applied on the reins at the right time will
keep the horses going perfectly straight and
true, without any pulling or jerking.</p>

<p>FIG. 33.—RIGHT HAND ASSISTING LEFT (ON THREE REINS ONLY).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Treating four reins as if only three.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
To attain this end it is very convenient to
treat the four reins as if there were only three,
the two off-side reins being treated as one and
always kept together (fig. 33). Then all that
is necessary is to place the third and fourth
fingers on the off-side reins, and the middle
finger on the near leader to check the tendency
of the leaders to run to the right or of
the wheelers to the left, or else the middle
finger on the near wheeler (fig. 33), to check
the tendency of the leaders to run to the left
or the wheelers to the right. This cannot be
too strongly impressed on the reader, as the
right hand has to be more frequently used in
this way than in any other.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Watching an omnibus driver is a good lesson.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
A very good and inexpensive lesson in
driving may be obtained by riding on the
box seat of an omnibus by the side of a good
driver through the most crowded parts of
London. The driver has not only to gauge
his own pace accurately, but also that of
the other vehicles he is meeting and passing.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Judging pace of other carriages.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This renders it absolutely necessary for him
to keep his eyes looking well to the front and
not always riveted on the horses, otherwise
he will be unable to judge exactly the relative
positions of his own and the other vehicles on
the road, all of which, at any given moment,
will most probably be moving at different
rates of speed.</p>

<p class='c004'>These things have to be calculated to a
nicety and almost instantaneously, if the
coachman wishes to wend his way at a steady
and a fairly uniform pace through the busy
traffic of crowded thoroughfares like those of
the Metropolis.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Change of pace must be gradual.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When he finds that it would be impossible
to get through by continuing at an even pace,
he must either go faster or slow down. But
in either case the change of speed should be
gradual, so as to avoid any sudden jerks.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Pulling up with jerk, bad driving.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
To be obliged frequently to pull up with a
jerk not only indicates bad driving, but causes
the greatest discomfort to both passengers
and horses. Many London coachmen are in
the habit of treating their passengers in this
way, with the result that they are perpetually
jolted out of their seats and experience
sensations which are both unpleasant and
irritating.</p>

<p class='c004'>The reason is not far to seek—these coachmen
are bad judges of pace, interval, and
distance, and do not see till too late whether
it is possible to get through or not. They
first hit their horses to try and get through,
and then at the last moment finding it impossible
are obliged to pull up suddenly. With
a heavy coach it is impossible to pull up at
once, so that the chances are a collision will
occur.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How to judge width of coach.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The width of a coach is judged as far as
the driver is concerned by the leaders’ bars.
They are always, or they ought to be, rather
wider than the pipe boxes of the wheels, so
that the driver knows with the greatest certainty
that wherever his bars will pass his
coach will pass also, always provided that he
is going straight. If he is on a curve he will
have to make some allowance for his hind
wheels, as their track will pass a little inside
that of the fore.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>In passing give room to other carriages.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When passing a carriage do not move
across the road more than is necessary, but at
the same time, once having overtaken it, do
not pull across its front until well clear, unless
compelled to do so. It is considered bad
form to oblige another driver to slow down
unnecessarily. Begin to cross in plenty of
time, so as to make the incline as gradual
as possible, and thus avoid pulling at the
horses. It is far better and safer for the
beginner to give himself plenty of room,
and to slow down at once if he is not
certain of getting through. Nothing should
be left to chance.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Take a pull before going down hill.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Always take a pull at the horses to steady
them just before you arrive at the crest of a
hill, and begin to descend the other side
slowly. The pace can always be increased,
but it is most difficult to check it if you find
that you have too much way on.</p>

<p class='c004'>In crossing over a bridge, like the ordinary
canal bridge, where the rise and fall of the
road are very sharp, be careful the leaders are
out of draught, otherwise the jerk on the pole
might cause it to snap.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The break.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> As regards the break, the driver should
put it on and take it off himself, as no one
else can tell the exact moment when it is
required or when it can be dispensed with;
but with the beginner, who probably has
quite as much as he can do to manage the
reins, it is advisable to have assistance. It
should be put on, as a rule, before the coach
is actually on the incline, and, if another
hill has to be ascended immediately, it
should be taken off before actually arriving
at the bottom, in order to take advantage of
the way on the coach to assist in mounting
the opposite ascent.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Coming off racecourse.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> When coming off a racecourse with a
heavy load never pull up if it can possibly
be avoided, but keep moving at any price,
however slowly, the wheels will then never
have time to sink deeply into the ground.
When this happens with a team that is inclined
to jib, it is long odds against getting
started again without a considerable loss of
time.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>On slippery stones or asphalt.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When coming on to slippery stones or
asphalt the horses will require holding rather
more firmly than before, and it is advisable
to slow down a little when approaching a
corner, otherwise the wheelers are liable to
slip up in turning it.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Wheeler slipping going down hill.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
If, while going down a hill, and especially
when near the bottom, you find a wheeler
slipping on to his hocks, do not try to pull
him up, but drop your hand and allow the
team to go a trifle faster.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Place right hand on reins passing startling objects.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It is a good plan for the novice to accustom
himself to place his right hand on the reins
when passing anything on the road, or any
object by the side of it, which might startle
the horses, so as to be ready to check them at
once should they show any tendency to shy
in either direction.</p>

<p class='c004'>Naturally the beginner will find that it
takes some little time for his right hand to
get into the habit of instinctively seizing the
proper reins when a sudden emergency arises,
and accidents occur so very quickly that I
think these precautions may save him from
many a mishap. <i>Experientia docet.</i></p>

  <h2 id='ch10' class='c007'>CHAPTER X <br /> <br /> TANDEM DRIVING.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Principles of tandem driving.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sc'>The</span> fundamental principles of tandem driving
are very naturally almost the same as those of
driving a coach. But the chief difference
between the two styles arises from the fact
that both horses in a tandem turn much more
quickly and with far less pressure on the reins,
more especially the leader, than the pair
of horses, either wheel or lead, in a coach.
Furthermore, the tendency to wobble about
the road is much greater, necessitating a much
more frequent use of the right hand; so that
it really requires greater quickness and lighter
hands to drive a tandem than a coach.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Great nicety and quickness required.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
On the other hand, a tandem can turn on its own
ground and everything is in front of the
driver, whereas a coach requires a large space
to turn in, and often a good allowance has to
be made for the hind wheels.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Advantages of tandem.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
One of the greatest recommendations of
a tandem is that it is well within the reach of
many who cannot afford a team. The small
extra expense and trouble which the leader
entails are fully compensated for by the extra
enjoyment which everyone feels when driving
behind a perfect and well-appointed tandem.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Idea of tandem being dangerous is erroneous.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It is quite a mistake to suppose that a
tandem is necessarily a very dangerous turn-out
to sit behind. It is nothing of the sort, if
driven by an experienced coachman and the
horses are fairly trained.</p>

<p class='c004'>Of course horses that have never been
driven in single harness cannot be safe in
a tandem. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Almost any horse will go in tandem.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But almost every horse that will
go in single harness, and some that will not,
will make perfectly safe leaders with very
little teaching. It must be thoroughly understood
that there is an immense difference
between the terms a perfectly safe leader and
a perfect leader. A horse may be a perfectly
quiet animal, which will not kick, nor do anything
that will get one into difficulties or
danger, but yet be a terrible slug. This
would altogether prevent one driving him
rapidly through traffic; therefore, though a
perfectly safe animal, he is not a perfect
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Frequent use of right hand necessary.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
leader. As mentioned above, it is necessary
to use the right hand very frequently when
driving a tandem, in order to immediately
check every tendency the leader may have to
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Follow leader if he turns suddenly.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
cross the road or to turn round a corner. But
if by any chance the leader has got well on
the turn before you are able to check him, do
not then try and do so, but apply the principle
of “Follow my leader” at once. Follow
after him, and when the horses are straight
turn round and come back again. Do just
the same if you are standing still, and the
leader suddenly comes right round. Whilst
turning the wheeler, back him if possible,
so as to give the leader plenty of room.
By this means you will never get the leader
tied in an inextricable knot.</p>

<p class='c004'>If it is not possible to follow the leader
round, hit him on the side of the head with
the whip, which will probably induce him to
get back into his place.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Position of left hand and method of holding reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The left hand should be held in the same
position as when driving four horses, and the
reins held in precisely the same way, but as
these matters have been thoroughly discussed
in a previous chapter it is unnecessary to go
into them again here.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Position of right hand when on reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The right hand ought to be placed on
the reins in front of the left, with the
little and third fingers together over the two
off-side reins, the middle finger over the
near-wheel, and the first finger over the
near-lead (fig. 35); all the reins will then

<p>FIG. 35.—TANDEM—POSITION OF RIGHT HAND ON REINS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The two off-side reins should in all cases,
except for a sharp back turn to the right,
be treated as one rein, and always kept under
the little and third fingers of the right hand.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Three-rein principle.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This, which may be termed the three-rein principle,
will be found to simplify matters very
considerably, owing to there being practically
only three reins to think about instead of four.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Difficult to get right hand quickly into the reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The beginner will experience considerable
difficulty at first in passing his right hand
quickly on and through the reins in the
proper manner, the reason being that they
are all close together, much more so than
with four horses, so that he is obliged
to stretch the right hand much further
forward in order to get it in between them.
For this reason, carry your hand well out to
the front, where the reins open out a little, and
when once you have hold of them correctly
slide it back towards the body. It looks very
awkward to drive with the right hand held
out a long way from the left, and it is
also quite unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Always keep right hand on reins at night.
<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> For those who have not much experience,
it is far better to keep the right hand
always on the reins, and particularly so at
night, when the hand should never be taken
away unless it is required for the purpose
of using the whip. Rarely pull one rein
singly, as described for pointing the leaders
in a coach, except when looping a lead
rein in order to turn a sharp corner, or to
execute a quick bend to get through traffic.
If you pull a rein singly, especially a lead
rein, you are very likely to overdo it or
jerk it.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Never pull rein as if ringing a bell.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Never jerk a rein at all except in an emergency,
but apply the pressure steadily and
gradually. The only excuse for “ringing the
bell” with a rein is when driving a slug which
is not going quite up to his bit, when you
want to turn a corner.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is generally advisable, whenever possible,
to advance a few paces before turning
round in a road from the halt. The
best methods of avoiding any jerking when
going round corners with free-going horses
are as follows:—</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Turning to the left.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> To turn to the left, slide the right hand
slightly to the front and catch hold of the near-lead
rein with the forefinger, and then bring
the right hand back towards the left, allowing
the other fingers to slide over, but not to
move away from their proper reins. The
near-lead rein will then be looped under
the first finger (fig. 36). When the leader is
turning nicely round the corner, tighten the
little and third fingers on the off-side reins,
and apply as much pressure as is necessary by
turning the wrist away from the body; thus
bringing the little finger closer to it. This will
have the effect of checking any tendency of
the leader to turn too fast, while also preventing
the wheeler from following round too
quickly after him, and cutting the corner.</p>

<img src='images/i185.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 36.—TANDEM—TURNING TO THE LEFT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>If the wheeler is still turning too fast, drop
the left hand towards the right, which will
slack the near-wheel rein and so keep him off
to the right, or away from the corner. Should
the leader not turn quickly enough, seize the
loop which is held by the forefinger of the
right hand with the left thumb, retaining it
there in the same manner as previously
described for “pointing” a rein. Another loop
can then be taken up as before, which will
bring the leader round as fast as is desired.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Best method of turning to right.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
To turn to the right, slide the right hand to
the front, and with the middle finger seize the
near-wheel rein; draw the hand back about an
inch or two, still retaining a grip of the near-wheel,
but sliding the fingers over the other
reins. This is done in order to prevent the
wheeler coming round too quickly. Then
tighten the little and third fingers on the off-side
reins, and press strongly on them (fig. 37).
This will have the effect of bringing the leader
round to the right. If the leader is not
coming round sufficiently fast, turn the back
of the left hand down gradually, this will
enable you to turn him with the greatest
nicety.</p>

<div id='i187'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i187.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 37.—TANDEM—TURNING TO THE RIGHT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The above methods are especially recommended,
as they entirely do away with the
necessity of taking the right hand out of the
reins for looping purposes, the great danger of
which is that it is almost impossible to get the
right hand back between them quickly enough
to prevent the wheeler cutting the corner, if
he is at all inclined to do so, or to check the
leader if he is coming round too rapidly. The
horses turn so quickly, that the wheeler can
see the leader coming round almost before the
lead rein can be seized with the left thumb,
and tandem reins being very close together, it
is difficult for the right hand to catch the
wheeler’s rein in time to check him. The fact
is that several things have to be done simultaneously,
or nearly so, to obtain perfection,
and the manipulation of the reins is then, as I
have often heard it expressed, somewhat like
playing the harp. Of course with very sluggish
horses the reins can be looped in the
same manner as when driving four horses,
but as a rule less rein must be taken up,
or the leader will come round and look you in
the face. Therefore you must always be
ready to pull the opposite rein, and so check
the horse from going too far round.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Proper time to turn leader at a corner.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Practice alone will enable one to hit off
exactly the proper moment to turn the leader
when a sharp corner has to be negotiated.
Perhaps the best general guide is to give the
leader the office when his head is abreast of
the centre of the road to be turned down.
More than this it is useless to say, as everything
depends on the width of the road and
the angle of the turn. It is, however, always
a safe thing to take as much room as possible,
and it is therefore a good plan before arriving
at the corner to pass off to the opposite side
of the road, provided the traffic will allow this
to be done.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Quickness of handling reins necessary in traffic.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In order to turn corners nicely with the
wheeler going over the same ground as the
leader, and not shuffling round anyhow, or to
go in and out rapidly through traffic like
that of London, requires the utmost nicety
and quickness of handling, and also that the
horses be well trained to keep constantly up
to their bits, and to feel even the lightest
pressure and answer to it at once.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Horses should answer to pressure of driver’s hands at once.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When you drop your hand to them, they should at once increase their
pace until you come back
to the original pressure, but the moment
more than this is put on they should at once
check their pace. They should also willingly
go into an omnibus if driven there, and never
shy off. Such is a perfect tandem, but one
most difficult to find.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Tendency to slow down.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
A beginner at tandem driving, and even
some who have had a certain amount of
practice in driving four horses, will usually
find the tandem has a great tendency to slow
down, and that a considerable amount of
whip is required to keep the horses up to the
proper pace. This tendency will be found to
disappear if a practised hand takes the reins,
without the aid of the whip. A want of
lightness of hand is usually the cause, and a
want of give and take to the horses’ mouths.
Probably the wrist is kept too stiff, and the
pressure on the horses’ mouths is as a result
uneven, too much being applied at one
moment and not enough the next. To keep
an even feeling on the horses’ mouths the
hand must be allowed to move backwards
and forwards a little, and there should be
plenty of play from the wrist.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Effect of altering centre reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When you find that the leader is going off
to the left, and the wheeler to the right, it is
usually right to push the two centre reins
back a little through the left hand from the
front with the right hand, using the whole
hand to do it with.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Reins must be held firmly.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
If, on the contrary, the leader is bearing off
to the right, and the wheeler to the left, you
must then pull the two centre reins out a
little until they, <i>i.e.</i>, the horses, are straight.
You must remember that, although you are
using the right hand a great deal, the reins
must none the less all the time be held very
firmly in the left, and not allowed to slip in
the least; so that at any moment you should
be able to take the right hand off the reins
and the horses should still be going exactly
one behind the other, with all the reins tight,
the left wrist turned in towards the body with
the back of the hand to the front and almost
perpendicular.</p>

<p class='c004'>This position of the left hand is of great
importance, as by turning the back down or
up respectively a great deal can be done in
the way of directing the leader to the right
or left without any assistance from the right
hand.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Thumb and forefinger always ready to take up loop.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The thumb should be nearly parallel
to the front, and like the first finger should be
ready at any time to take up and hold a loop
of either lead rein; therefore these fingers
should never be busy gripping the reins.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Third and fourth fingers must grip reins tightly.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The whole four reins should be held firmly
in position by the grip of the third and little
finger, slightly assisted by the middle finger.</p>

<p class='c004'>To get horses, which have never been in
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Tendency to form a pair.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
tandem before, exactly to follow one behind
the other, requires considerable skill and
patience, as it will be found that their
common tendency is to get one alongside
the other, the wheeler as a rule being anxious
to run up alongside the leader. This tendency
to form a pair must be checked at
once, but without any jerking or hurried
pulling at the reins.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Do not worry leader.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The leader should be worried as little as
possible; therefore, do not pull him across
the road more than you can avoid, particularly
at first, but try to make the wheeler
follow him, and you will find that if they are
fairly well-disposed horses they will soon fall
in with the idea of following one another.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Constant use of whip shows bad coachman.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Do not use the whip perpetually; try and
work the horses chiefly with your hands, and
to a certain extent by your voice. For
instance, when starting them give them the
office by slightly feeling their mouths with
the reins and immediately shouting “Go on,”
or something to that effect, momentarily
dropping your hand to them in order to
avoid any jibbing while getting under way.
The horses will very quickly understand this,
and the use of the whip will be unnecessary.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Wheeler should start cart.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Remember, however, that the wheeler should
start the cart; therefore be ready to touch
him with the whip, if he hangs back; if,
however, he is inclined to jib, it may be
better to allow the leader to assist him.</p>

<p class='c004'>With raw and nervous horses a good start is
everything. Watch the leader carefully, and
when you see him starting get the wheeler
off at once by using the whip if he is not
moving off at the same time. When pulling
up, I think it is always a good plan to say
“Whoa.” They very soon learn to obey the
voice, and it often comes in handy.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Encourage horse with voice.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
If a horse shies, speak to him at once and
encourage him, but on no account hit him or
you will confirm him in the habit. He does
it nearly always from nervousness, or from
defective vision, and not from devilry.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Never hit a shyer.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> A
shyer will often go perfectly in the wheel of a
tandem and never shy at all, but is never safe
in the lead. I am also a believer in rating a
horse soundly when he does wrong, and
especially when you are hitting him, as the
next time you rate him he will think he is
going to feel the whip, and be very careful
at once.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Returning lash after hitting leader.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In a dog-cart, when you have hit your
leader, bring the lash back and catch it
quickly with a turn round the stick by a
slight jerk, or bring it straight into the fingers
of your right hand by the same motion.
You can then at once bring it well into the
cart, and get your hand back on the reins.
This last is a very important matter, as when
the leader is hit he generally takes to pulling
for a few yards, and your whip hand is much
needed on the reins to steady him.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the other hand, it is very unsafe to
bring your right hand on to the reins unless
the lash has been brought well into the cart,
as it may easily be caught up round the axle
or get under the wheel; and, as a rule, if the
wheel goes over it, it will break off at that
spot next time you use it.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is often very convenient to have the
whip ready to hit the leader at a particular
place or corner which he is likely to want
to go round. To do this unwind the lash,
and keep the point of the stick out to the
right front. The lash can then fly loose and
do no harm, unless the wind is blowing across
from right to left.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Check pace before going down hill.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Always check the pace before reaching
the crest of a hill which you are about to
descend, as when once on the downward
slope this may not be possible, whereas to
increase the pace is easy enough. When
going down a hill it will be necessary to
shorten up all four reins, either by pulling
them through from behind with the thumb
and forefinger (fig. 4), or by placing the right
hand on the reins as before explained and
sliding the left up to it (fig. 35). Sometimes
it will be found necessary when going down a
very steep hill to pull back the leader a little,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Leader out of draught down hill.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but as a rule the mere fact of the wheeler
coming out of draught to hold back the cart
will necessitate the shortening of all the reins,
which will bring the leader sufficiently out of
his collar to prevent him pulling on the
traces.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Shortening lead reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The leader’s reins can be shortened either
by taking out both the lead reins with the
right hand (fig. 32), the near lead under the
first or second finger, the off lead under the
little finger, and then replacing them in the left
hand, or else by pushing them through from
the front with the right hand in front of the
left, the latter being usually far the best
plan.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Leader doing too much work.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
While on this subject, it may be well to
remark that the novice is usually inclined to
allow the leader to do a great deal too much
work. The traces should never be quite taut
except when going up a hill, and then the
leader may be allowed to do his best. The
result of allowing the leader to do all the
work on the flat is that the wheeler soon
learns to hang back, and thus makes his companion
pull him along as well as the cart, and
when this happens it is almost impossible to
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Turning while going up hill.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
negotiate a sharp turn safely. From this it is
evident that, when going up a hill with the
leader well in draught, he must be taken out
of the collar before a turn is attempted, otherwise
the wheeler will be forced to cut the
corner.</p>

<p class='c004'>From this chapter it will be seen, that
although the general principles of driving a
tandem are the same as those of driving four
horses, yet there are many minor points of
difference, which the man, who wishes to
drive both with equal skill, must carefully
study and practise.</p>

<p class='c004'>One very notable difference, which may be
pointed out again, is the greater lightness and
quickness of handling necessary to guide a
tandem with ease and safety through difficult
places.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tandem is therefore admirably adapted for
ladies who are fond of driving, as it affords all
the interest of a team, without placing any
undue strain on their strength or powers of
endurance, while it enables them to exercise
those qualities of quickness and lightness
of hands, in which as a rule they surpass
men.</p>

<p class='c004'>The whole art of driving is composed of
innumerable small, though most important
details, but probably no other class of driving
requires so much attention to be paid to these
minutiæ as Tandem.</p>

  <h2 id='ch11' class='c007'>CHAPTER XI <br /> <br /> TANDEM HARNESS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Best kind of harness simple and light.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sc'>The</span> harness should be as simple and as
light as possible, consistent with strength.
The colour is a matter of taste and convenience,
but perhaps for country work
brown with brass mounts is the most suitable,
whereas for driving in the Park black harness
is almost <i>de rigueur</i>. Certainly for soldiers
at home, and more especially abroad, brown
is far the most useful, because it is a part of
every mounted soldier’s training to clean this
kind of leather.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Wheel harness.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The wheeler’s harness is an ordinary single
set with one or two trifling additions, none of
which are absolutely necessary. These are
two brass rings or loops fixed under the trace
buckles, into which are fastened the spring
hooks of the leader’s traces, and terrets on
the pad divided by a roller to separate the
reins. For the former short pieces of leather
can be substituted, which have holes punched
in one end, through which the tongues of the
trace buckles pass, while at the other end are
sewn metal rings to take the hooks of the
leader’s traces.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Lead harness.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The leader should have a
pad of rather lighter make than the wheeler,
with two fixed leather loops, one at each side,
for the traces to run through. There must
also be a bearing-strap passing over the
horse’s loins, and this should be just long
enough to keep the traces level.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Lead traces.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The traces are usually made long enough
to be fixed to the loops on the wheeler’s
traces, as already described. This is the
simplest and most economical plan, but
another method consists in having two
swingle bars, by means of which the leader’s
traces can be reduced to the same length as
those of the wheeler.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Swingle bars.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The first of these bars, which is about two
feet six inches in length, has a large hook
about five inches long fixed in its front, and a
light chain about one foot long attached at
the back. The chain is hooked to a ring in
the bottom of the wheeler’s hames, and is
intended to prevent the bar from falling
down. At each end of the bar are two short
traces about two feet long, which hook into
the wheeler’s trace in the same way as previously
described for the long ones.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Advantages of swingle bars over long traces.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The second bar is a light swingle-tree
about two feet in length, having an eyelet
to attach it to the hook of the other bar.</p>

<p class='c004'>Advocates for this system claim that it is
less dangerous than the other, because neither
horse can get a leg over the trace, nor can a
trace wrap round the leader’s quarter if he
swings suddenly round to study the view in
rear. The second method however entails
more expense and trouble than the first, which
with careful driving need rarely be the cause
of accidents.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Traces hooked to shafts dangerous.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The leader’s traces are sometimes hooked
to the points of the shafts, but as this is a
most dangerous system it should never be
employed.</p>

<p class='c004'>I have seen tandem traces extemporized
out of ordinary single-harness traces and pole
chains, the latter bridging the gap between
the wheeler’s traces and the leader’s. This
arrangement looked very smart, but must
make the lead traces too heavy.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Breast harness.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Although not so smart as a collar, breast
harness can be used in tandem equally as well
as in single harness, and as it can be adjusted
to fit any horse its use avoids the necessity of
spending money on numerous collars. It also
comes in very useful when a horse’s shoulders
have been wrung by a collar (see Chap. I.).</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Length of lead traces.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The length of the leader’s traces should
depend on the length of the horses and also
on their action. They should be as short as
possible, but not so short as to make the
wheeler appear to be stepping on the leader.
Three feet from nose to croup seems to be
about the right distance when the leader is in
draught.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Hooking up lead traces.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
While on the subject of the leader’s traces
it may be well to point out that the best way
to hook them up, when putting to or taking
out the leader, is to pass the end of the trace
from outside under and over itself just in
front of the bearing-strap, and then fasten the
hook to the ring of the hames.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How to fasten up lead reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
As regards the fastening up of the lead
reins, it is usual to take a loop in the end of
the rein and pass it through the terrets of
both pad and hames, so adjusting it that no
spare end hangs down by itself. The loop
will be about the right length if the end
of the rein is brought up to the terret on
the pad, the end of the loop thus made being
then put through the terrets as described
above.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Driving bits.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The best bits for all-round work are either the
Liverpool or the elbow-bits,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Wheeler’s bit.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but the wheeler’s
should be made with a light bar across the
bottom of the cheek pieces. This prevents
the wheeler from catching the lead rein under
the end of the cheek piece, which constantly
happens if he is inclined to shake his head
about, and has the effect of pulling the leader
sharply to one side. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Bit catching in rein.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It is, moreover, very
difficult to get the rein free when caught in
this way without getting down. I think, as a
rule, it is a good plan to pass the lead reins
through the loops of the bearing-rein of the
wheeler, instead of through D’s fixed on his
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Lead reins through bearing-rein loops.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
head-collar or throat-lash. The loops should
hang down about four inches, and be quite
loose, so that the wheeler can toss his head
to a considerable extent without violently
jerking the leader in the mouth. It is unnecessary
to pass the reins through the terrets
on the hames, as bringing them straight back
to those on the pad gives a better lead.</p>

<p class='c004'>Of course, if the wheeler habitually shakes
his head about very much, either up or down,
or both, then a martingale and a bearing-rein
must be put on, which will effectually stop
his little game.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Lead reins never to be buckled.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Never drive with the lead reins buckled, as,
if the leader breaks either the traces, or the
bar (if he has one), by kicking or falling, the
reins will run through the terrets, and the horse
can then get clear away, and a worse accident be avoided.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Leader’s tail over rein.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Should the leader get his tail over
a rein, a good way of getting it clear is to
pull the wheeler well across to the side on
which the rein is fast, and the leader rather
over to the opposite side, slacking at the
same time the fixed rein as much as possible.
By this manœuvre the rein will often come
loose. If it does not, try hitting the leader on
the quarter with the whip, when he will probably
swish his tail and allow the rein to drop.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Tandem whip.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The whip is generally a rather lighter and
shorter one than that used for four horses,
though the same can perfectly well be used.
The usual lengths of stick and lash are about
five and ten feet respectively. As to the correct
method of holding and handling it the reader
must kindly refer to a former chapter, where
it is fully discussed. The principles are
obviously exactly the same.</p>

  <h2 id='ch12' class='c007'>CHAPTER XII <br /> <br /> BREAKING TO HARNESS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Accustom horse to harness in stable.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sc'>In</span> conclusion, a few hints as to breaking a
horse to harness may be useful to those who
have had no experience in giving a young
horse his first lessons. In the first place,
it is a good plan to put the harness on in
the stable, and let the horse stand with it
on for a time, with his head on the pillar
reins.</p>

<p class='c004'>In India I found that with Australian
horses, even those trained to military draught,
it was absolutely necessary to accustom them
to blinkers before attempting to drive them.
They should be made to stand in their stables,
fed and taken out to water, and exercised
with blinkers on, previously to their being
driven for the first time, otherwise they will
almost invariably jib.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Longeing with long reins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
After the pupil is accustomed to his
harness, he should be taken out and longed
with two long reins (fig. 39), never with one
only. These can be conveniently made of
webbing, like a common single longeing rein,
but the lead reins of a tandem will also answer
the purpose. The horse should have a body
roller on with two rings or loops about half
way down each side, though an ordinary
single-harness driving pad with the tugs on,
or a saddle with the stirrup irons fixed up for
loops, can be substituted. In all cases a
crupper should be used.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Use snaffle and martingale.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It is always advisable to have a fairly loose
standing martingale on the bit, which should
be a large smooth snaffle, the martingale
being so adjusted that it will keep the bit on
the bars of the mouth, and will not allow the
horse to get his head up sufficiently high to
cause the bit to press only on the corners of
his lips.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Bearing-straps.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It is also advisable to put on bearing-straps
like those of a tandem leader, in order
to keep up the reins. The long reins should
be passed through the loops of the bearing-straps,
then through the rings on the roller,
the tugs on the pad, or the stirrup irons of
the saddle, as the case may be, and then
buckled on to the bit.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Use whip when longeing.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The horse can now be driven about and be
kept up to his bit with the whip, which the
operator should always have in his hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>Keep him circling with the outer rein
round his quarters above his hocks. This
will teach him to go collectedly, and enable
the driver to keep his quarters well in
towards the centre, preventing him from
passing off sideways like a crab. It is
impossible to attain this object with a single
rein, which also would have the effect of
teaching him to go on his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another point about having the rein
against the horse’s quarters is that it teaches
him not to kick at the trace or breeching.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Do not longe too long on one rein.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
If he should very much resent having the
outer rein on his hocks, begin by driving him
with this rein over his back. He should not
be kept circling too long on one rein, but be
often changed from one side to the other. If,
however, one side of his mouth is harder than
the other, he should be made to turn to that
side for a longer period, until he turns equally
well both ways.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the horse has learnt to answer the
rein at once, and turn equally well to both
sides, he should be taught to rein back.</p>

<p class='c004'>When this has been successfully accomplished,
bring him out with his harness on
and long traces like lead tandem traces.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Have two men pulling against traces.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Tell off two men to hang on to these while
he is being driven about. By this means the
amount of pressure can be regulated, and as
only a small amount need be applied to
begin with, the horse will become gradually
accustomed to pulling with his shoulders.
It is impossible to begin too gradually;
although some horses can be taken out of
the stable and put into a break or a coach at
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Jibbing taught by undue hurry.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
once and will go fairly well, others will be
rendered jibbers for ever by this too hurried
process.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Horse-breaking in India.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In India a young horse is generally given
his first lessons harnessed to a block of wood.
The block of wood is triangular in shape, and
in front of it is fixed a long splinter bar.
The horse’s traces are hitched to this, and the
breaker, standing on the block of wood, drives
his pupil about until he is quiet enough to be
put in a cart. A short pole, with a cross bar
at the top like a parrot’s perch, is fixed to the
front of the block, to enable the driver to
steady himself and prevent his being jolted
off.</p>

<p class='c004'>This is not at all a bad way of breaking a
horse, as he cannot do much harm by kicking
or plunging, and the block being very
light does not teach him to jib.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Steady horse alongside youngster.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The horse having been taught to pull is
now quite fit to be driven in a break or cart.
If possible, place him at first in a double
break, with a steady old horse alongside of
him, which will do all the starting by steady
pulling and not by jumping into the collar.
Many old break horses are quite up to watching
the young one, and start accordingly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Never forget to have a bearing-rein on, also
kneecaps and bandages.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Accustom to both sides of pole.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Drive the youngster on both sides of the
pole for a time, when he should be quite fit
to put into a single-harness break or cart.</p>

<p class='c004'>Always have a rope halter on a young
horse under the bridle the first few times that
he is put to. If he is likely to be very violent,
two halters may be put on, and you can then
have a man leading him on each side.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Take young horse among traffic.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It is far better to drive him where there is
some traffic than along a deserted country
road, for he will go much better if he sees
other things moving about, as they will distract
his attention, and keep him from playing
tricks on the driver.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Exercise before giving lesson.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It is advisable to have him well exercised
before attempting to give him any of the
above lessons.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Breaking in single cart.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Supposing that there is no double break
available, use a strong light cart with extra
strong shafts instead; but a heavy cart with
no springs is bad, as it will make a rattling
noise and possibly frighten the novice, while
its weight may teach him to jib.</p>

<p class='c004'>In this case put a good strong kicking-strap
on, but be careful not to buckle it
down too tight, or it will catch his quarters
if he should canter, and perhaps induce him
to kick.</p>

<p class='c004'>The bearing-rein must be loose, but tight
enough to prevent him from getting his head
close in to his chest. A loose martingale may
also be added if the horse has a tendency
to put his head up; fasten this to the nose-band.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Two men to assist in putting to.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Have a couple of men to hold him, and
try and put him in without the shafts touching
him anywhere. Hold the shafts well up,
and get the horse as nearly under them as
possible, and quite straight in front of the
cart; then lower them quietly and run the
cart up, passing the points of the shafts
through the tugs.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Hook traces before buckling kicking-strap.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Next hook the traces and buckle the kicking-strap
on as quickly as possible. One
man should be kept standing in front of the
horse and holding his head the whole time,
and he should never move away until the
driver is ready to start. It is a good plan
at this stage to lead the horse about by the
rope halter, with a man on each side ready
to assist, while the driver walks with the
reins in his hand on the off side of the cart.
He can thus guide him without getting up,
while the weight which the horse has to pull
to begin with is materially reduced.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>When quiet get up into cart.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
If he goes along all right, mount into the
cart and drive him about, keeping a man
running alongside for a little, when, if he
continues to go well, the man can jump up
behind. If he should be inclined to jib, have
him led on at once, but do not hit him.
Never let the man lead him by the rein, but
invariably by the nose-band or halter.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Turning lesson.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> When
he has gone well for some distance on the
straight, teach him to turn. Begin by turning
him if possible on a very large circle. If this
cannot be done, have him led round very
slowly, the man pushing the outer shaft at
the same time to assist him, as in turning
the inner one is bound to catch him on the
shoulder, when he will most probably passage
off sideways or rein back and get
frightened.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How to start a jibber.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
With a horse that continues to jib from
sheer cussedness, I have found that strapping
up one leg, and making him stand still until
he is tired out, will often induce him to start
off perfectly quietly as soon as the leg has
been released.</p>

<p class='c004'>A rope crupper may also be tried with
good effect. This is formed by taking an
inch rope about sixteen feet long and doubling
it. The loop is tied by a thumb-over-hand
knot, forming a crupper about two feet long.
Pass the loop under the tail and bring the
ends forward, one on each side; then put a
man to pull on each of these ends, and the
horse will most probably move forward at once.</p>

<p class='c004'>This system is a very useful one for getting
refractory horses into a stable or loose box.
In Ireland it is a common practice to rub
some gravel in a jibber’s mouth, and this
appears to be effective at times.</p>

<p class='c004'>When a horse is inclined to kick on first
being put in harness, he can often be prevented,
if not cured, by holding, or even tying
up a leg, as in the case of a jibber.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How to guard against pulling.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
If the horse is likely to be a hard puller, it
is a good plan to have a Liverpool bit in his
mouth, with two pairs of reins, one buckled
to the cheek and the other to the bar, the
latter only being used to check him if he is
pulling too hard.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Lessons must be continuous.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The lessons must be continued without intermission
daily for some considerable time,
or else it will be found that the pupil very
soon forgets what he has been taught.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How to fix up reins when taking out of cart.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
At the conclusion of the lesson, after
getting out of the cart, place the reins over
the off terret to prevent them from falling
on to the ground when the horse is being
led into the stable. Take care that the spare
parts, which hang down on each side of the
terret, are well in front of the stop on the
shaft; otherwise, if the horse should by any
chance jump to the front while the cart is
being run back,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Rein catching apt to cause an accident.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the rein may get caught
round the stop and give a sharp jerk to the
horse’s mouth, which will probably frighten
him.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>FIG. 40.—A BREAK BY HOLLAND AND HOLLAND.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Horses that have once been frightened in
this way seldom forget it, and are apt to
plunge forward directly they think they are
clear of the traces, which is a constant source
of accidents, as the horse may only get half
out of the shafts, and then he will probably
bolt. For this reason the kicking-strap must
always be unbuckled before the traces are
unhooked.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>How to prevent horse plunging forward out of shafts.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The best way of breaking a horse of this
very bad habit is to drive him straight up to
a wall, or into a corner where he cannot jump
forward; then unhook the traces and run the
cart back.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Accustom horse to bars in stable.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> A horse that is to be driven in the lead of
a team can be to some degree accustomed
to the bars, by having one tied on so as to
hang down and touch him just above his
hocks when standing in the stable.</p>

<p class='c004'>In conclusion, I would remind the reader
that “Prevention is better than cure,” and in
breaking a horse to harness every precaution
should be taken from the very beginning of
his education, for when a young horse has
once been hurt or frightened, it is a very
difficult thing to persuade him that the same
thing may not occur again, and many a
naturally quiet and generous horse is ruined
for harness work, or rendered nervous for life,
simply owing to carelessness or to want of
ordinary precautions during his first two or
three lessons.</p>

<p class='c004'>The beginner who has mastered the foregoing
pages will, I trust, find that he is
thoroughly grounded in the theory and
principles of driving, and his interest will, I
hope, be roused to such an extent as to
induce him so to turn theory into practice,
that with time and perseverance he will develop
into a neat and skilful whip.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Another book which will appeal to all who are interested
in horses is the capital little volume called ‘Hints on Driving,’
by Capt. Morley Knight, R.A. Captain Knight has nothing
to do with history or anecdote; his work is entirely practical.
Doubtless there are other books on the subject, but none
within our knowledge is more clear or complete in the instructions
given for driving in single or double harness, and,
above all, for the more difficult mysteries of four-in-hand or
tandem driving. The utility of the volume is much increased
by the accurate vignette illustrations of hands holding reins,
etc., made by G. H. A. White, Royal Artillery.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Captain Knight is the author of a thoroughly practical
book entitled ‘Hints on Driving,’ which he dedicates to
Major-General Albert Williams.”—<i>Morning Post.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“There are perhaps few greater masters of the detail of the
art than the author.”—<i>The Sportsman.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“One conspicuous and excellent feature is that it takes
nothing for granted, etc. Altogether this little volume is a
capital manual of its kind.”—<i>Glasgow Herald.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“It is simple, practical, and instructive. So far as the
delicate art of handling the ribbons can be taught by a
book, this book succeeds to the best effect in teaching it.”—<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“Any who are deficient or novices in the art of driving—and
it is an art—will do well to inwardly digest the contents
of a capital volume by Captain Knight, R. A., whose practical
advice, down to the veriest minutiæ, will work wonders in a
short space.”—<i>Sporting Life.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“Captain Knight has done as much as anyone could do to
place before his readers the more or less accepted canons of
driving. The book costs but little money, and anyone who
wants to drive properly would do well to invest his 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>,
and commit to memory some of the principal rules.”—<i>The
Field.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“A very businesslike and pleasant little book it is. Captain
M. Knight’s little book will be found far more serviceable
than the big work on Driving in the ‘Badminton Library.’
The book is provided with copious illustrations and diagrams.”—<i>National
Observer.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“The advice and details afforded by Captain Knight are
about as succinct, clear, and reliable as those which any pupil
can desire to acquire.”—<i>The Road.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“We have come to the conclusion that the author has
accomplished his design with no little success, and that
anyone who desires to drive properly would be well advised
to study Capt. Knight’s pages attentively before spending
much money in driving lessons.”—<i>Baily’s Magazine.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“Much which it is very necessary for the learner to know
may be acquired from a writer who is sufficient master of his
pen and of his subject to make his meaning clear. Such an
one is Captain C. Morley Knight, R.A., whose ‘Hints on
Driving,’ published by Bell and Sons, will supply a long-felt
want.”—<i>Referee.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“The neophyte in handling the ribbons has found an
excellent friend in Captain C. M. Knight, R.A., whose
‘Hints on Driving’ are exactly what the beginner needs.
Capt. Knight is a master in the art, and whatever he says is
the fruit of practical experience.”—<i>Army and Navy Gazette.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“Quite fulfils its author’s object,—namely, to explain to
beginners the rudimentary principles and niceties of
driving.”—<i>United Service Gazette.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“A most useful, practical, and handy little work on all
that appertains to driving in single and double harness—including
four-in-hand and tandem driving.”—<i>Broad Arrow.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“We have not for some time come across such a thoroughly
practical and sound handbook as this.”—<i>Admiralty and Horse
Guards Gazette.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“This little octavo volume should have an immense sale in
India, where every household keeps its trap. Herein is given
information and instruction on every conceivable point connected
with the mysterious craft of Whip and Reins.”—<i>The
Pioneer</i> (Allahabad).</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is pleasant to meet with a little volume like Captain
Knight’s ‘Hints on Driving,’ so erudite and yet so simple.”—<i>Times

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
